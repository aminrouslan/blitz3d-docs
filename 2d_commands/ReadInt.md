# ReadInt (filehandle/stream)

## Parameters

filehandle/stream = a valid variable set with the OpenFile, ReadFile command,  or OpenTCPStream (v1.52+)

The value returned is an integer in the range -2147483648 to 2147483647

---

## Description

Once you've opened a disk file (or stream) for reading, use this command  to read a single integer value from the file. Note, each value written uses  4 bytes of space and is written least significant byte first. Reading beyond  the end of file does not result in an error, but each value read will be zero.

Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Reading and writing a file using ReadInt and WriteInt functions; Initialise some variables for the example

Int1% = 10 ; store 10

Int2% = 365 ; store 365

Int3% = 2147483647 ; store 2147483647 the largest positive Integer Value in  BlitzBasic )

Int4% = - 2147483648 ; store -2147483648 the largest negative Integer Value  in BlitzBasic ); Open a file to write to

fileout = WriteFile("mydata.dat"); Write the information to the file

WriteInt( fileout, Int1 )

WriteInt( fileout, Int2 )

WriteInt( fileout, Int3 )

WriteInt( fileout, Int4 ); Close the file

CloseFile( fileout ); Open the file to Read

filein = ReadFile("mydata.dat")

Read1 = ReadInt( filein )

Read2 = ReadInt( filein )

Read3 = ReadInt( filein )

Read4 = ReadInt( filein ); Close the file once reading is finished

CloseFile( filein )

Print "Integer Data Read From File - mydata.dat "

Print Read1

Print Read2

Print Read3

Print Read4
