# LoadImage (Filename)

## Parameters

filename = string designating full path and filename to image.

---

## Description

This command loads an image from disk and assigns it a file handle. You  will use the DrawImage command to display the graphic  later. The demo version of Blitz Basic supports BMP files; the full retail version  of Blitz Basic supports JPG and PNG format as well.

Many multimedia loading commands for fonts, graphics, and sounds require the  use of FILE HANDLES. You'll need to have a good understanding of file handles  if you are going to successfully use Blitz Basic.

A file handle is a variable (usually GLOBAL) that holds  a unique identifier for a loaded item (font, image, sound, music, etc.). This  unique number is used later for subsequent operations to designate the loaded  item. This file handle allocates the memory to hold the item.

You will find file handles used all over Blitz. See the example for some well-documented  code.

Note that when you change the graphics mode using the Graphics command, all images that were loaded will be lost, and all handles will become invalid.  However, with BlitzPlus, the images will sometimes be retained.  Expect more control over this in the next BlitzPlus update.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; LoadImage and DrawImage example; Declare a variable to hold the graphic file handle

Global gfxPlayer; Set a graphics mode

Graphics 640,480,16; Set drawing operations for double buffering

SetBuffer BackBuffer(); Load the image and assign its file handle to the variable; - This assumes you have a graphic called player.bmp in the; same folder as this source code

gfxPlayer=LoadImage("player.bmp"); Let's do a loop where the graphic is drawn wherever the; mouse is pointing. ESC will exit.

While Not KeyHit(1)

Cls ; clear the screen

DrawImage gfxPlayer,MouseX(),MouseY() ; Draw the image!

Flip ; flip the image into view and clear the back buffer
