# CopyImage (handle)

## Parameters

handle=the variable you gave the handle to when you loaded the image

---

## Description

Instead of loading a graphic twice in two different handles, you can load  the image ONCE then use the CopyImage command to make as many copies in memory  as you want.

Why would you want to do this? So you still have a copy of the original image  in case you want to alter a copy later for another purpose.

---

## Example

```blitzbasic
; CopyImage Example; Load an image and give its handle to gfxOld variable

gfxOld=LoadImage("mypicture.bmp"); Duplicate the gfxOld image to a new handle variable

gfxNew=CopyImage(gfxOld)
```
