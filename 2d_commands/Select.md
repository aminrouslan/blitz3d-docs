# Select variable

## Parameters

variable - any valid variable

---

## Description

This command allows you to set up a selection structure that, based on the  value of the variable you feed it, will execute different commands in different CASEs. You can also specify a DEFAULT  set of commands to happen if NONE of the CASEs are met. The selection structure  is ended with an END SELECT command.

This selection structure removes the need for large nested IF/THEN condition  checking. See the example for more.

See also: Case, Default, True, False, If.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; SELECT/CASE/DEFAULT/END SELECT Example; Assign a random number 1-10

mission=Rnd(1,10); Start the selection process based on the value of 'mission' variable

Select mission; Is mission = 1?

Case 1

Print "Your mission is to get the plutonium and get out alive!"; Is mission = 2?

Case 2

Print "Your mission is to destroy all enemies!"; Is mission = 3?

Case 3 

Print "Your mission is to steal the enemy building plans!"; What do do if none of the cases match the value of mission

Default 

Print "Missions 4-10 are not available yet!"; End the selection process

End Select
