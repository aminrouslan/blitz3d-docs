# Read variable

## Parameters

variable = valid variable to match the data type you are reading (integer,  string, etc)

---

## Description

This reads the next value in a set of Data statements. This allows you to  store large blocks of constant information (the structure of tile blocks for  a game level for example) into easy to maintain Data statements, then retrieve  them for redrawing, etc.

Unlike most BASIC languages, Data statments do not have to be linear and sequential.  Through the use of Labels (aka 'dot variable') you can create 'banks' of Data  statments with the unique ability to 'Restore the Data pointer' to any one of  these labels. Each level could have its own label (.level1, .level2, etc). See  the Data statement, Restore  command, or .Label command for more information.

Note: You can read multiple values at one time; Read X,Y,Z for example.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Sample of read/restore/data/label commands; Let's put the data pointer to the second data set

Restore seconddata; Let's print them all to the screen

For t = 1 To 10

Read num ; Get the next data value in the data stack

Print num

Next; Now for the first set of data

Restore firstdata; Let's print them all to the screen

For t = 1 To 10

Read num ; Get the next data value in the data stack

Print num

Next; this is the first set of data.firstdata

Data 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10; this is the second set of data.seconddata

Data 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20
