# ImageBuffer (handle[,frame])

## Parameters

handle=variable holding the image's handle

frame=optional frame to draw to if using an imagestrip image

---

## Description

There are 1000 reasons for this command. Simply put, you may want to 'draw'  on an existing image you've loaded (LoadImage or LoadAnimImage) or created (CreateImage).  You could, for example, have a blank wall graphic and you want to add 'graffiti'  to it based on the user action (Jet Grind Radio baybeee! Sorry...). Instead  of trying to draw a dozen images all over the wall, just use the SetBuffer command to denote the wall graphic as  the 'target' buffer, and draw away! Next time you display that graphic (DrawImage),  you will see your changes! This is a powerful command!

## Example

```blitzbasic
; CreateImage/TileImage/ImageBuffer example; Again, we'll use globals even tho we don't need them here; One variable for the graphic we'll create, one for a timer

Global gfxStarfield, tmrScreen; Declare graphic mode

Graphics 640,480,16; Create a blank image that is 320 pixels wide and 32 high with 10 frames of  32x32

gfxStarfield=CreateImage(32,32,10); loop through each frame of the graphic we just made

For t = 0 To 9; Set the drawing buffer to the graphic frame so we can write on it

SetBuffer ImageBuffer(gfxStarfield,t); put 50 stars in the frame at random locations

For y = 1 To 50

Plot Rnd(32),Rnd(32)

Next

Next; Double buffer mode for smooth screen drawing

SetBuffer BackBuffer(); Loop until ESC is pressed

While Not KeyHit(1); Only update the screen every 300 milliseconds. Change 300 for faster or; slower screen updates

If MilliSecs() > tmrScreen+300 Then 

Cls ; clear the screen; Tile the screen with a random frame from our new graphic starting at; x=0 and y=0 location.

TileImage gfxStarfield,0,0,Rnd(9)

Flip ; Flip the screen into view

tmrScreen=MilliSecs() ; reset the time

End If
