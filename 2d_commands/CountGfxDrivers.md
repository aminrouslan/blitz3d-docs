## Parameters

None.

## Description

Some computers may have more than one video card and/or video driver installed  (a good example is a computer system with a primary video card and a Voodoo2  or other pass-through card). Once you know how many drivers there are, you can  iterate through them with GfxDriverName$ and  display them for the user to choose from. Once the user has chosen (or you decide),  you can set the graphics driver with SetGfxDriver.  Normally, this won't be necessary with 2D programming.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; GfxDriver Examples; Count how many drivers there are

totalDrivers=CountGfxDrivers()

Print "Choose a driver to use:"; Go through them all and print their names (most people will have only 1)

For t = 1 To totalDrivers

Print t+") " + GfxDriverName$(t)

Next; Let the user choose one

driver=Input("Enter Selection:"); Set the driver!

SetGfxDriver driver

Print "Your driver has been selected!"
```
