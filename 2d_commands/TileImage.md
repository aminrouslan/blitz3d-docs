# TileImage handle,[x],[y],[frames]

## Parameters

handle= variable holding the image's handle

x=starting x location of the tile; assumed 0

y=starting y location of the tile; assumed 0

frames=the frame of the image to tile; optional with imagestrip

---

## Description

If you want to make a starfield or other easy tiled background, this is  YOUR command. All you have to do is specify the image handle (an image loaded  with the LoadImage or LoadAnimImage command). Optionally, you can  specify a starting x and y location, as well as an optional frame. You can milk  some serious parallax effects with a simple imagestrip with a couple of various  starfields and the TileImage command.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; CreateImage/TileImage/ImageBuffer example; Again, we'll use globals even tho we don't need them here; One variable for the graphic we'll create, one for a timer

Global gfxStarfield, tmrScreen; Declare graphic mode

Graphics 640,480,16; Create a blank image that is 320 pixels wide and 32 high with 10 frames of  32x32

gfxStarfield=CreateImage(32,32,10); loop through each frame of the graphic we just made

For t = 0 To 9; Set the drawing buffer to the graphic frame so we can write on it

SetBuffer ImageBuffer(gfxStarfield,t); put 50 stars in the frame at random locations

For y = 1 To 50

Plot Rnd(32),Rnd(32)

Next

Next; Double buffer mode for smooth screen drawing

SetBuffer BackBuffer(); Loop until ESC is pressed

While Not KeyHit(1); Only update the screen every 300 milliseconds. Change 300 for faster or; slower screen updates

If MilliSecs() > tmrScreen+300 Then 

Cls ; clear the screen; Tile the screen with a random frame from our new graphic starting at; x=0 and y=0 location.

TileImage gfxStarfield,0,0,Rnd(9)

Flip ; Flip the screen into view

tmrScreen=MilliSecs() ; reset the time

End If
