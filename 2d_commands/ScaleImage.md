# ScaleImage image,xscale#,yscale#

## Parameters

image = file handle variable to a previously loaded image

xscale# = the amount to scale the image horizontally

yscale# = the amount to scale the image vertically

---

## Description

Use this command to rescale an image to a new size using a floating point  percentage (1.0 = 100%, 2.0 = 200%, etc). Using a negative value perform image  flipping. You must've previously loaded the image with LoadImage or LoadAnimImage.

This is NOT intended for REAL TIME scaling of images! Precalculate your images  before running your program, or you will likely see massively slow renderings  of graphics.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; ScaleImage example; Set Graphics Mode

Graphics 800,600,16; Randomize the random seed

SeedRnd MilliSecs(); Load an image to tile (your location might vary)

gfxBall=LoadImage("C:Program FilesBlitz Basicsamplesall.bmp"); Scale it randomly from 50% to 150% both x and y

ScaleImage gfxBall,Rnd(-2.0,2.0),Rnd(-2.0,2.0); Wait for ESC to hit

While Not KeyHit(1)

DrawImage gfxball,Rnd(800),Rnd(600)
