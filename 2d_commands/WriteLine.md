# WriteLine$ (filehandle/stream, string$)

## Parameters

filehandle/stream = a valid variable set with the OpenFile, WriteFile command,  or OpenTCPStream (v1.52+). The value returned is a text string.

string$ = valid string value.

---

## Description

Once you've opened a disk file (or stream) for writing, use this command  to right a whole line of text to the file. Each line of text is automatically  terminated with an "end-of-line" mark, consisting of a Carriage Return character  followed by a LineFeed character. (i.e. 0Dh, 0Ah ) This function can be used  to make plain text files.

Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Reading and writing a file using ReadLine$ and WriteLine functions; Initialise some variables for the example

String1$ = "Line 1 is short"

String2$ = "Line 2 is a longer line but they can be much longer"

String3$ = "Line 3 is made up "

String4$ = "of two parts joined together."; Open a file to write to

fileout = WriteFile("mydata.txt"); Write the information to the file

WriteLine( fileout, String1 )

WriteLine( fileout, String2 )

WriteLine( fileout, String3 + String4)

WriteLine( fileout, "Just to show you don't have to use variables" ); Close the file

CloseFile( fileout ); Open the file to Read

filein = ReadFile("mydata.txt")

Read1$ = ReadLine( filein )

Read2$ = ReadLine$( filein )

Read3$ = ReadLine$( filein )

Read4$ = ReadLine$( filein ); Close the file once reading is finished

CloseFile( filein )
