# RecvNetMsg()

## Parameters

None.

---

## Description

First off, this ONLY works when you have joined a network game via StartNetGame or JoinNetGame  and you have created a player via CreateNetPlayer  (you must create a player, even if it is just to lurk).

This returns a TRUE value if a message was received, FALSE if none has been  received. This will typically go inside a function that is constantly being  checked for message and decode and handle them. You will use NetMsgType, NetMsgFrom, NetMsgTo, and NetMsgData$  to get the important information from the message and act on it.

The example requires that you run it on a remote machine while the local computer  runs the example in the SendNetMsg command.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; RecvNetMsg() example; --------------------; Run this program on the REMOTE computer to 'watch'; the activity of the SendNetMsg example. Run that; example on local machine.;; This program will tell you when a player involved in; the game hits a wall ...; We'll use this instead of JoinHostGame - make it easier

StartNetGame(); Create a player - a player must be created to; receive mesages!

playerID=CreateNetPlayer("Shane"); Loop and get status

While Not KeyHit(1); Check to see if we've received a message

If RecvNetMsg() Then; if we did, let's figure out what type it is; we know it will be a user message, though

msgType=NetMsgType(); 1-99 means a user message

If msgType>0 And msgType<100 Then; Let's see who the message was from

msgFrom=NetMsgFrom(); Let's get the message!

msgData$=NetMsgData$(); Print the message

Print msgData$

End If

End If
