# ImageRectOverlap (image,x,y,rect x,rect y,rect width,rect height)

## Parameters

image = Image to test collision against

x = image's x location

y = image's y location

rect x = x location start of the rect to test

rect y = y location start of the rect

rect width = width of the rect

rect height = height of the rect

---

## Description

There are many times when you need to see if an image has collided with  (or is touching) a specific rectangular area of the screen. This command performs  a collision detection between the image of your choice and a specified rectangle  on the screen. Transparent pixels are ignored during the collision process,  making this command a bit inaccurate for odd shaped graphics. See ImageRectCollide for pixel perfect collisions  between an image and rectangular area of the screen.

The usefulness of this comes into play when you think of a game like Monkey  Island - when you might have a backdrop on the screen showing a room that has  items in it the player can interact with using a mouse pointer graphic. In some  cases, the items on the screen you wish to interact with will be seperate (often  animated or moving) images of their own. For this situation, you would be better  off using ImagesCollide or ImagesOverlap to detect the collision between  pointer graphic and the image.

Howevever, should your program just need to detect a graphic (like a mouse pointer)  over at a particular location/region of the screen (often called a 'hot spot'),  this command works great!

As with any collision in Blitz, you will need to know the PRECISE location of  the graphic you wish to test collision with, as well as the x, y, width, and  height of the screen area (rect) you wish to test.

The example blatently uses graphics that are much smaller than their container  to show you how inaccurate this command can really be - if not used carefully.  The ImageRectCollide example is identical  to this one - and shows how accurate the pixel-perfect collision method can  be with graphics of this nature.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; ImageRectOverlap Example; Turn on graphics mode

Graphics 640,480,16; Create new empty graphic to store our circle in

gfxCircle=CreateImage(50,50); Draw the circle image; Set drawing operations to point to our new empty graphic

SetBuffer ImageBuffer(gfxCircle)

Color 255,0,0; Note the extra space between the circle and the edge of the graphic

Oval 10,10,30,30,1; Let's not forget to put the drawing buffer back!

SetBuffer BackBuffer()

Color 0,0,255; Locate our box to a random, visible screen location

hotX=Rnd(50,610)

hotY=Rnd(50,430)

hotW=Rnd(20,100)

hotH=Rnd(20,100); Repeat the loop until we've had a collision

Repeat ; Attach our mouse to the circle to move it

circleX=MouseX()

circleY=MouseY(); Standard double buffer technique; clear screen first

Cls; Draw our rectangle

Rect hotX,hotY,hotW,hotH,0

DrawImage gfxCircle,circleX,circleY; Standard double buffer technique; flip after all drawing is done

Flip; We test the locations of our rectangle area and circle to see if they have  overlapped

Until ImageRectOverlap (gfxCircle,circleX,circleY,hotX,hotY,hotW,hotH); Loop is over, we must've collided!

Text 0,0, "WE'VE HAD A COLLISION! PRESS A MOUSE BUTTON"; Can't see the text until we flip ..

Flip; Wait for a mouse click

WaitMouse(); End our graphics mode

EndGraphics
