# HandleImage image,x,y

## Parameters

image = variable holding the file handle to the image

x = x location of the new image handle location

y = y location of the new image handle location

---

## Description

When an image is loaded with LoadImage, the  image handle (the location within the image where the image is 'drawn from')  is always defaulted to the top left corner (coordinates 0,0). This means if  you draw an image that is 50x50 pixels at screen location 200,200, the image  will begin to be drawn at 200,200 and extend to 250,250.

This command moves the image handle from the 0,0 coordinate of the image to  the specified x and y location in the image. You can retrieve an image's current  location handle using the ImageXHandle and ImageYHandle. Finally, you can make all images  automatically load with the image handle set to middle using the AutoMidHandle command.

Note about the term 'handle'. There are two types of 'handles' we discuss in  these documents. One is the location within an image - as discussed in this  command. The other is a 'file handle', a variable used to hold an image, sound,  or font loaded with a command. See LoadImage for  more information about file handles.
