# Local variable

## Parameters

variable = any valid variable name

---

## Description

This command is probably just here for compatibility with other BASIC languages.  LOCAL will let you specify that the variable you are defining is available ONLY  to the program or Function you are assigning it in.  In order to get a variable to be accessible anywhere in your program, you need  to make it GLOBAL. I say it is only here for compatibility  because whenever you assign a variable that isn't Global, it is automatically  assigned as a LOCAL variable. You can optionally assign a value to the variable  at the time of declaration. See example.

See also: Global, Const, Dim.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Local example; set lives to 5 for the main program loop

Local lives=5; Call a function

while not keyhit(1)

showlives()

Wend

Function showlives(); For this function, lives will be 10!

Local lives=10

Print lives

End Function
```
