# Shl repetitions

## Parameters

repetitions = number of shifts to make left

---

## Description

This performs a left binary shift on the value the specified number of times.  This basically is a faster method of multiplying the value exponentially. By  shifting left once, you are multiplying the value by 2. By shifting left twice,  you multiple by 4, etc.

The usefulness of this command is basically faster math execution.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; shl, shr, sar examples

value = 100; multiple x 2

Print "Shift 1 bit left; Value = " + value Shl 1; multiple x 4

Print "Shift 2 bits left; Value = " + value Shl 2; multiple x 16

Print "Shift 4 bits left; Value = " + value Shl 4; divide by 2

Print "Shift 1 bit right; Value = " + value Shr 1; divide by 4

Print "Shift 2 bits right; Value = " + value Shr 2; divide by 16

Print "Shift 4 bits right; Value = " + value Shr 4

Print "Shift by SAR 4 times = " + value Sar 4
