# While condition

## Parameters

condition = any valid conditional statement

---

## Description

The WHILE/WEND loop is used when you wish to execute a series of commands  multiple times based on whether a condition is true or not. This is similar  to the REPEAT/UNTIL loop, except the condition checking is at the beginning  of the loop, instead of at the end. Usually you'll use WHILE/WEND when you aren't  sure whether or not the looped commands will even need to be executed once,  since you can actually stop the loop before any commands are executed if the  condition check fails. If you need to execute the commands in the loop at least  once before checking a condition, use REPEAT/UNTIL. See example.

```blitzbasic
; While/Wend Example; The loop condition is at the TOP of the loop

Print "Press Esc to end this mess!" ; Print this

Wend ; Go back to the start of the WHILE loop
