# RotateImage image,value#

## Parameters

image = variable containing the image handle

value# = floating number from 0 to 360 degrees

## Description

I'm going to start this description off with:

This command is not fast enough to render rotations in real time!

Now, the purpose of this command is to rotate an image a specified number of  degrees. Since it is slow, you will need to pre-calculate rotated images with  this command. This means, before the program actually displays the images you  rotate, you will want to rotate them ahead of time.

This command automatically dithers/anti-aliases the rotated graphic image, so  it might mess with your transparency. To avoid this issue, use the TFormFilter command. This will render the rotated  images with bi-linear filtering.

I'm going to end this command with:

This command is not fast enough to render rotations in real time!

## Example

```blitzbasic
; RotateImage/TFormFilter Example; Turn on graphics mode

Graphics 640,480,16; Change the 0 to a 1 to see the difference; between filter on and off.

TFormFilter 0; Create new empty graphic to store our circle in

gfxBox=CreateImage(50,50); Draw the box image; Set drawing operations to point to our new empty graphic

SetBuffer ImageBuffer(gfxBox)

Color 255,0,0; Note the extra space between the box and the edge of the graphic

Rect 10,10,30,30,1

SetBuffer FrontBuffer()

While Not KeyHit(1); Make a copy of the image so we are always using a fresh one each time; we rotate it.

gfxTemp=CopyImage(gfxBox); Rotate it a random value and draw it at a random location

RotateImage gfxTemp,Rnd(360)

DrawImage gfxTemp,Rnd(640),Rnd(480)
