## Description

If you haven't read up on the TYPE command, you might  want to do so before continuing.

When you define a custom Type, you need to assign some variables to track  within in. Using the Field command within the Type .. End Type commands, you set a variable that  can be used for EACH object created with the NEW command.

See also: Type, End Type.
