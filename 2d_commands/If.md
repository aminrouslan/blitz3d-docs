None.

## Description

Use this to check the value of a variable or to see if a condition is true  or false. The code between IF and END IF (or ENDIF) is executed if the condition  is true. Using NOT, you can also act if the condition is NOT true - or use ELSE  to perform a different set of commands than if the condition is met. Lastly,  you can use 'nested' or multiple IFs through the use of ELSE IF (or ELSEIF)  to do LOTS of condition checking. If you get too deep in condition checking,  consider using SELECT structures instead.

See also: Then, Else, ElseIf, EndIf, True, False, Select.

name$=Input$("What is your name? "); Doesn't the person's name equal SHANE?

If name$ = "Shane" Then

	Print "You are recognized, Shane! Welcome!"

Else

	Print "Sorry, you don't belong here!"; End of the condition checking

End If
