# WriteString (filehandle/stream, mystring$)

## Parameters

filehandle/stream = a valid variable set with the OpenFile, WriteFile command,  or OpenTCPStream (v1.52+)

mystring$ = any string variable or text contained between quotes.

---

## Description

Once you've opened a disk file (or stream) for writing, use this command  to write a string variable to the file.

Each string is stored in the file as a 4 byte (32bit) integer followed by the  characters that form the string. The integer contains the number of characters  in the string, i.e. its length. Note, that Carriage Return, Line Feed and Null  characters are NOT use to indicate the end of the string. A file of strings  cannot be read like a text file, since it contains string variables and not  text. A null string, i.e. a string of zero length ("") is stored as 4 bytes,  an integer count with a value = zero, followed by no Characters. Note strings  are not limited to 255 characters as in some languages. Reading beyond the end  of file does not result in an error, but each value read will be a zero length  string.

Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Reading and writing a file using ReadString$ and WriteString functions; Initialise some variables for the example

String1$ = "A short string"

String2$ = "A longer string since these are variables lengths"

String3$ = "This is string3 "

String4$ = "joined to string4"; Open a file to write to

fileout = WriteFile("mydata.dat"); Write the information to the file

WriteString( fileout, String1 )

WriteString( fileout, String2 )

WriteString( fileout, String3 + String4)

WriteString( fileout, "Just to show you don't have to use variables" ); Close the file

CloseFile( fileout ); Open the file to Read

filein = ReadFile("mydata.dat")

Read1$ = ReadString$( filein )

Read2$ = ReadString$( filein )

Read3$ = ReadString$( filein )

Read4$ = ReadString$( filein ); Close the file once reading is finished

CloseFile( filein )

Print "String Variables Read From File - mydata.dat "

Print

Print Read1

Print Read2

Print Read3

Print Read4
