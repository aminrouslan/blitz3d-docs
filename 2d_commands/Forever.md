# Forever

## Parameters

None.

## Description

Replace the UNTIL command in aREPEAT ... UNTIL loop to make the loop run forever.  Remember, the program execution will continue indefinately until either you  break out of it programmatically! This is often known as 'the infinate loop'.  Once more for the cheap seats: "Make sure you provide a means for breaking out  of the loop". Use EXIT (to leave the loop) or END to quit the program.
