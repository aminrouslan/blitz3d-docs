# ExecFile( file$ )

## Parameters

file$ - the file to be executed

---

## Description

The usefulness of this command is really mostly for calling some system level command, launching a browser, etc. 

Note: This command uses ShellExecute to allow you to 'open' any file (like a  .doc or .txt) file with its default associated program.

Also: if the filename path has spaces in it you may will need to chenge the call like so:

ExecFile (Chr$(34)+"example file name.exe"+Chr$(34))

This adds the " (quotation mark) character to the beginning and end of the text string.
