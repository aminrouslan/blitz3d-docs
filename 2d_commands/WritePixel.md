# WritePixel x,y,argb,[buffer]

## Parameters

x - y-coordinate of pixel

y - y-coordinate of pixel

argb - argb colour value of pixel (alpha, red, green, blue)

buffer (optional) - name of buffer to write colour value to, e.g. BackBuffer()

---

## Description

Writes a color value to either the current buffer or the specified buffer.

You can use this command on a locked buffer for a slight speed-up.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; ReadPixel/WritePixel Example; ----------------------------

Graphics 640,480,16

Print "Press a key to read color values (this may take a few seconds)"

WaitKey(); Load and draw an image on to the screen - can be anything

pic=LoadImage("media/blitz_pic.bmp")

DrawImage pic,0,0 ; Initialise an array big enough to fit all the color information of the screen

Dim pix(GraphicsWidth(),GraphicsHeight()); Use ReadPixel to get all the color information of the screen

For y=0 To GraphicsHeight()

For x=0 To GraphicsWidth()

pix(x,y)=ReadPixel(x,y)

Next

Next

Cls

Locate 0,0

Print "Press a key to write pixels (this may takes a few seconds)"

Print "Once this has finished, you can then press a key to end the program"

WaitKey(); Use WritePixel to redraw the screen using the color information we got earlier

For y=0 To GraphicsHeight()

For x=0 To GraphicsWidth()

WritePixel x,y,pix(x,GraphicsHeight()-y) ; get y array value in backwards order,  to flip screen

Next

Next

WaitKey()
