## Parameters

ip$=Address of stream

port=TCP/IP Port Number

## Description

Use this command to open up a TCP/IP stream to the designated server and  port. If the open command was successful, the command returns a stream handle.  Otherwise it returns 0.

You can use this for a multitude of different 'internet' options. Obviously  to contact a TCP/IP host outside your own network, you'll need to be connected  to the Internet.

The IP address can be in the form of 1.2.3.4 or "www.domain.com".
