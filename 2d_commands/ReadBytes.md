# ReadBytes bank,file/stream,offset,count

## Parameters

bank = variable containing handle to valid bank

file/stream = file handle of previously opened file or stream

offset = offset in bytes to write the value

count = how many bytes to write from the offset

---

## Description

You can read the contents of a disk file (or stream) to a memory bank using  this command.

Note: The file handle must be opened with OpenFile  or OpenTCPStream and subsequently closed with CloseFile or CloseTCPStream  after the reading operations are complete.

Return how many bytes successfully read from a stream.

Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

See also: WriteBytes.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Read/WriteBytes Commands Example; Create a 50 byte memory bank

bnkTest=CreateBank(500); Let's fill the bank with random data

For t = 1 To 50

	PokeByte bnkTest,t,Rnd(255)

Next; Open a file to write to

fileBank=WriteFile("test.bnk"); Write the bank to the file

WriteBytes bnkTest,fileBank,0,50; Close it

CloseFile fileBank; Free the bank

FreeBank bnkTest; Make a new one

bnkTest=CreateBank(500); Open the file to read from

fileBank=OpenFile("test.bnk"); Write the bank to the file

ReadBytes bnkTest,fileBank,0,50; Close it

CloseFile fileBank; Write back the results!

For t = 1 To 50

	Print PeekByte (bnkTest,t)

Next
