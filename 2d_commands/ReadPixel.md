# ReadPixel (x,y,[buffer])

## Parameters

x - x coordinate of pixel

y - y coordinate of pixel

buffer (optional) - name of buffer to read colour value from, e.g. BackBuffer() (defaults to current graphics buffer)

---

## Description

Reads a color value from either the current buffer or the specified buffer.

The returned colour value is in the form of an integer that contains the alpha, red, green and blue values of the pixel. 

You can use this command on a locked buffer for a slight speed-up. See LockBuffer. 

Warning: this is a low level command with no error checking for out of range parameters, use with care.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; ReadPixel/WritePixel Example; ----------------------------

Graphics 640,480,16

Print "Press a key to read color values (this may take a few seconds)"

WaitKey(); Load and draw an image on to the screen - can be anything

pic=LoadImage("media/blitz_pic.bmp")

DrawImage pic,0,0 ; Initialise an array big enough to fit all the color information of the screen

Dim pix(GraphicsWidth(),GraphicsHeight()); Use ReadPixel to get all the color information of the screen

For y=0 To GraphicsHeight()

For x=0 To GraphicsWidth()

pix(x,y)=ReadPixel(x,y)

Next

Next

Cls

Locate 0,0

Print "Press a key to write pixels (this may takes a few seconds)"

Print "Once this has finished, you can then press a key to end the program"

WaitKey(); Use WritePixel to redraw the screen using the color information we got earlier

For y=0 To GraphicsHeight()

For x=0 To GraphicsWidth()

WritePixel x,y,pix(x,GraphicsHeight()-y) ; get y array value in backwards order,  to flip screen

Next

Next

WaitKey()
