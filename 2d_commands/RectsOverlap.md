# RectsOverlap (rect1 X,rect1 Y,rect1 Width,rect1 Height,rect2 X,rect2 Y,rect2 Width,rect2 Height)

## Parameters

rect1 X = rectangle 1 x location

rect1 Y = rectangle 1 y location

rect1 Width = rectangle 1 width

rect1 Height = rectangle 1 height

rect2 X = rectangle 2 x location

rect2 Y = rectangle 2 y location

rect2 Width = rectangle 2 width

rect2 Height = rectangle 2 height

---

## Description

This command will take two rectangular locations on the screen and see if  they overlap. You will need to know the x, y, width, and height of both regions  to test.

I'm still trying to find a real good logical use for this command with all the  other collision commands available to you like ImagesOverlap, ImagesCollide, ImageRectOverlap, and ImageRectCollide. My guess is that this is  the absolute fastest possible collision method available and useful to those  wishing to write their own collision routines.

Unlike the other collision commands, there is no image to detect a collision  with - simply one rectangular location overlapping another. You could probably  use this command instead of the ImageRectOverlap  command, as they are really basically doing the same thing (and I betcha this  is faster).

This would be useful for very easy-going 'Monkey Island' games to check the  position of your pointer against a screen location (or 'hot spot') when pixel  perfect accuracy (heck, image graphics in general) are not really needed.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; RectsOverlap Example; Flashing graphics warning! Gets hypnotic ...; Turn on graphics mode

Graphics 640,480,16; Double buffering, and randomize the randomizer

SetBuffer BackBuffer()

SeedRnd MilliSecs(); Repeat the loop until ESC pressed

While Not KeyHit(1); Generate a random rectangle

rect1X=Rnd(50,610)

rect1Y=Rnd(50,430)

rect1W=20

rect1H=20; And another

rect2X=Rnd(50,610)

rect2Y=Rnd(50,430)

rect2W=20

rect2H=20; Clear the screen standard double buffering

Cls; Draw our rectangle2 in random colors

Color Rnd(255),Rnd(255),Rnd(255)

Rect rect1X,rect1Y,rect1W,rect1H,0

Color Rnd(255),Rnd(255),Rnd(255)

Rect rect2X,rect2Y,rect2W,rect2H,0; Did they collide? If so, print a message and exit the loop!

If RectsOverlap (rect1X,rect1Y,rect1W,rect1H,rect2X,rect2Y,rect2W,rect2H) Then

Text 0,0, "Our boxes finally collided! Press a mouse button..."; We do a flip here to ensure the text message gets seen too!

Flip

Exit ; exit the While/Wend loop

End If; Flip the rects into view, wait 1/10th of a sec, repeat

Wend; Wait for a mouse click
