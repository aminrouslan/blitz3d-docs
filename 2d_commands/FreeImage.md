# FreeImage handle

## Parameters

handle=variable that holds the image handle of a previously loaded image

---

## Description

When you are done with an image, use this command to delete the image from memory and free up that memory for other use. Good housekeeping. Get in the habit!

Note that the variable to the Image is not reset to 0 upon using FreeImage, nor will any other variables pointing to the same Image.  If you try to access the handle again, it will result in an error.  It is good practice to set the handle to zero immediately after freeing the image, as you can then check whether an image has already been freed or not.
