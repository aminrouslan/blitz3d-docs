# Sar repetitions

## Parameters

repetitions = number of shifts to make right

---

## Description

This performs a right binary shift on the value the specified number of times.  This basically is a faster method of dividing the value exponentially. By shifting  right once, you are dividing the value by 2. By shifting right twice, you divide  by 4, etc.

Sar command varies from Shr whereas it fills blank bits  shifted with copies of the sign bit, 0 for positive numbers and 1 for negative. 

The usefulness of this command is basically faster math execution. Also see Shl.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; shl, shr, sar examples

value = 100; multiple x 2

Print "Shift 1 bit left; Value = " + value Shl 1; multiple x 4

Print "Shift 2 bits left; Value = " + value Shl 2; multiple x 16

Print "Shift 4 bits left; Value = " + value Shl 4; divide by 2

Print "Shift 1 bit right; Value = " + value Shr 1; divide by 4

Print "Shift 2 bits right; Value = " + value Shr 2; divide by 16

Print "Shift 4 bits right; Value = " + value Shr 4

Print "Shift by SAR 4 times = " + value Sar 4
