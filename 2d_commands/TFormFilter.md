# TFormFilter enable

## Parameters

enable = 0 to turn off filtering; 1 to turn it on

---

## Description

This command will enable or disable bi-linear filtering on images that are  convoluted (altered) by commands like TFormImage  and RotateImage.

This filtering allows the convoluted graphics to have smoother, more aliased  edges. This also makes the operations slower. The bi-linear filtering can also  create non-transparent edges what will mess with your transparency. Experiment  for the best results.

Try changing the example to see the difference.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; RotateImage/TFormFilter Example; Turn on graphics mode

Graphics 640,480,16; Remove the line below to see the difference; between filter on and off.

TFormFilter 0; Create new empty graphic to store our circle in

gfxBox=CreateImage(50,50); Draw the box image; Set drawing operations to point to our new empty graphic

SetBuffer ImageBuffer(gfxBox)

Color 255,0,0; Note the extra space between the box and the edge of the graphic

Rect 10,10,30,30,1

SetBuffer FrontBuffer()

While Not KeyHit(1); Make a copy of the image so we are always using a fresh one each time; we rotate it.

gfxTemp=CopyImage(gfxBox); Rotate it a random value and draw it at a random location

RotateImage gfxTemp,Rnd(360) 

DrawImage gfxTemp,Rnd(640),Rnd(480)
