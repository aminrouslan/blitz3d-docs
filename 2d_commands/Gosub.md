# Gosub label

## Parameters

label = any valid exisiting label

---

## Description

This branches the flow of the program to a designated label, with the understanding  that there will be a Return later on in the called code to resume execution  of the program where the Gosub was called. With the use of Functions inside  of Blitz, it isn't very practical to use Gosubs, but you may still find it useful.  If you do not require the need to return execution back to the Gosub statement,  you may use Goto instead. See the example.

## Example

```blitzbasic
Print "The program starts ..."

Gosub label1

Print "The Program ends ..."; wait for ESC key before ending

While Not KeyHit(1)

Print "We could do all sorts of things in this part of the program..."

Print "But, we'll just go back to the original code, instead ..."

Return
