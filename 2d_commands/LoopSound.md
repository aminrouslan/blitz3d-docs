# LoopSound sound_variable

## Parameters

sound_variable = variable previously assigned with a LoadSound command.

---

## Description

This command sets up play back a sound file (.WAV or .MP3) in an endless  loop (like for background music). You must load a variable with a sound file  using the LoadSound command. Use a Global variable  to ensure your sound loop can be played from anywhere in your program. Note:  This command doesn't actually PLAY the sound loop, just sets it up for looping.  You still need to execute the PlaySound command  to hear the sound.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Assign a global variable for the sound loop

Global sndMusicLoop; Load the sound loop file into memory

sndMusicLoop=LoadSound("sounds/loop1.wav"); Set the sound loop

LoopSound sndMusicLoop

PlaySound sndMusicLoop
```
