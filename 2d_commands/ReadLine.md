# ReadLine$ (filehandle/stream)

## Parameters

filehandle/stream = a valid variable set with the OpenFile, ReadFile command,  or OpenTCPStream (v1.52+). The value returned is a text string.

---

## Description

Once you've opened a disk file (or stream) for reading, use this command  to read a whole line of text from a text file or stream. Each line of text is  returned as a string variable. This function can be used to read plain text  files.

Characters are read from the input file until an "end-of-line" mark is found.  An "end-of-line" can be a single carriage return (0Dh) or a single linefeed  (0Ah) or carriage return followed by a linefeed (0Dh, 0Ah). Reading beyond the  end of file does not result in an error, but each value read will be a zero  length string.

ReadLine$ returns all chars except chr$(13)/chr$(10).

Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Reading and writing a file using ReadLine$ and WriteLine functions; Initialise some variables for the example

String1$ = "Line 1 is short"

String2$ = "Line 2 is a longer line but they can be much longer"

String3$ = "Line 3 is made up "

String4$ = "of two parts joined together."; Open a file to write to

fileout = WriteFile("mydata.txt"); Write the information to the file

WriteLine( fileout, String1 )

WriteLine( fileout, String2 )

WriteLine( fileout, String3 + String4)

WriteLine( fileout, "Just to show you don't have to use variables" ); Close the file

CloseFile( fileout ); Open the file to Read

filein = ReadFile("mydata.txt")

Read1$ = ReadLine$( filein )

Read2$ = ReadLine$( filein )

Read3$ = ReadLine$( filein )

Read4$ = ReadLine$( filein ); Close the file once reading is finished

CloseFile( filein )

Print "Lines of text read from file - mydata.txt "
