# NetMsgData$()

## Parameters

None.

---

## Description

First off, this ONLY works when you have joined a network game via StartNetGame or JoinNetGame  and you have created a player via CreateNetPlayer  (you must create a player, even if it is just to lurk). You must've received  the message already, determined by the RecvNetMsg()  command - and probably determined the type of message with (NetMsgType().

The string value returned from this command is the actual message text that  was sent.

You will use NetMsgType(), NetMsgFrom(), and NetMsgTo()  to get other important information from the message and act on it.

The example requires that you run it on a remote machine while the local computer  runs the example in the SendNetMsg command.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; NetMsgData$() example; --------------------; Run this program on the REMOTE computer to 'watch'; the activity of the SendNetMsg example. Run that; example on local machine.;; This program will tell you when a player involved in; the game hits a wall ...; We'll use this instead of JoinHostGame - make it easier

StartNetGame(); Create a player - a player must be created to; receive mesages!

playerID=CreateNetPlayer("Shane"); Loop and get status

While Not KeyHit(1); Check to see if we've received a message

If RecvNetMsg() Then; if we did, let's figure out what type it is; we know it will be a user message, though

msgType=NetMsgType(); 1-99 means a user message

If msgType>0 And msgType<100 Then; Let's see who the message was from

msgFrom=NetMsgFrom(); Let's get the message!

msgData$=NetMsgData$(); Print the message

Print msgData$

Print "(Message was to:"+ NetMsgTo() + ")"

End If

End If
