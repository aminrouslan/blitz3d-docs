# NetPlayerLocal (playerID)

## Parameters

playerID = a valid player ID number (get from the NetMsgFrom() command)

---

## Description

First off, this ONLY works when you have joined a network game via StartNetGame or JoinNetGame  and you have created a player via CreateNetPlayer  (you must create a player, even if it is just to lurk).

Use this command in conjunction with the NetMsgFrom()  (to get the player's ID) command to check and see if the player in question  is on the local machine (as opposed to a remote machine). You may wish to act  differently in your program based on whether the message that came in was from  a local or remote machine.

You will use NetMsgType(), NetMsgFrom(), and NetMsgTo()  to get other important information from the message and act on it.

The example requires that you run it on a remote machine while the local computer  runs the example in the SendNetMsg command.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; NetPlayerLocal example; --------------------; Run this program on the REMOTE computer to 'watch'; the activity of the SendNetMsg example. Run that; example on local machine.;; This program will tell you when a player involved in; the game hits a wall ...; We'll use this instead of JoinHostGame - make it easier

StartNetGame(); Create a player - a player must be created to; receive mesages!

playerID=CreateNetPlayer("Shane"); Loop and get status

While Not KeyHit(1); Check to see if we've received a message

If RecvNetMsg() Then; if we did, let's figure out what type it is; we know it will be a user message, though

msgType=NetMsgType(); 1-99 means a user message

If msgType>0 And msgType<100 Then; Let's see who the message was from

msgFrom=NetMsgFrom(); Let's get the message!

msgData$=NetMsgData$(); Print the message

Print msgData$

if NetPlayerLocal(NetMsgFrom()) then

print "(This was sent from a local player)"

end if

End If

End If
