# WriteByte (filehandle/stream, mybyte)

## Parameters

filehandle/stream = a valid variable set with the OpenFile, ReadFile command,  or OpenTCPStream (v1.52+)

mybyte = can be an Integer or a floating point number, but only values between  0 and 255 will be stored faithfully.

---

## Description

Once you've opened a disk file (or stream) for reading, use this command  to write a single byte at a time to the file/stream. Note, a byte is an integer  that can take the values 0..255 and occupies 8 bits of storage. Since characters  are stored as byte values this function can be used to create a text file one  character at a time.

Advanced notes:

The number that is stored by WriteByte is actually the least significant byte  of an integer so negative numbers and numbers above 255 will still have a value  between 0..255. Unless you understand how 32 bit integers are stored in 2's  compliment notation this will seem strange but it is NOT a bug.

Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Reading and Writing a file using ReadByte and WriteByte functions; Initialise some variables for the example

Byte1% = 10 ; store 10

Byte2% = 100 ; store 100

Byte3% = 255 ; store 255 ( the maximum value that can be stored in a Byte )

Byte4% = 256 ; try to store 256 this will end up as 0 ( i.e. 256 - 256 = 0 )

Byte5% = 257 ; try to store 257 this will end up as 1 ( i.e. 257 - 256 = 1 )

Byte6% = -1 ; try to store -1 this will end up as 255 ( i.e. 256 -1 = 255 )

Byte7% = -2 ; try to store 256 this will end up as 254 ( i.e. 256 - 2 = 254  )

Byte8% = Asc("A") ; Store the ASCII value for the Character "A" ( i.e. 65 ); Open a file to write to

fileout = WriteFile("mydata.dat "); Write the information to the file

WriteByte( fileout, Byte1 )

WriteByte( fileout, Byte2 )

WriteByte( fileout, Byte3 )

WriteByte( fileout, Byte4 )

WriteByte( fileout, Byte5 )

WriteByte( fileout, Byte6 )

WriteByte( fileout, Byte7 )

WriteByte( fileout, Byte8 ); Close the file

CloseFile( fileout ); Open the file to Read

filein = ReadFile("mydata.dat")

Read1 = ReadByte( filein )

Read2 = ReadByte( filein )

Read3 = ReadByte( filein )

Read4 = ReadByte( filein )

Read5 = ReadByte( filein )

Read6 = ReadByte( filein )

Read7 = ReadByte( filein )

Read8 = ReadByte( filein ); Close the file once reading is finished

CloseFile( filein )

Print "Written - Read"

Write Byte1 + " - " : Print Read1

Write Byte2 + " - " : Print Read2

Write Byte3 + " - " : Print Read3

Write Byte4 + " - " : Print Read4

Write Byte5 + " - " : Print Read5

Write Byte6 + " - " : Print Read6

Write Byte7 + " - " : Print Read7

Write Byte8 + " - " : Print Chr$( Read8 )
