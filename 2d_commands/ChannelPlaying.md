# ChannelPlaying (channel_handle)

## Parameters

channel_handle = variable assigned to the channel when played

---

## Description

Often you will need to know if a sound channel has completed playing or  not. This command will return 1 if the sound is still playing or 0 if it has  stopped. Use this to restart your background music or some other sound that  might have stopped unintentionally.

Note: This command currently doesn't seem to work with a channel assigned to  CD track playback.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Channel examples

Print "Loading sound ..."; Load the sample - you'll need to point this to a sound on your computer; For best results, make it about 5-10 seconds...

sndWave=LoadSound("level1.wav")

Print "Playing full sample until sound is done ..."

chnWave=PlaySound(sndWave) 

While ChannelPlaying(chnWave)

Wend 

Print "All done!"
