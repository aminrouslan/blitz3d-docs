# Data list_of_values

## Parameters

list_of_values = a list of comma delimited values (strings must be inside  quotes)

---

## Description

Data is used to create neat, comma delimited lists of values of a constant  nature that you will be reading (and probably reusing) during the execution  of your game. You may store level information (number of enemies, stars, etc)  there or just about anything you can think of! You can easily mix datatypes  (strings, integers, floats) in your Data statements, as long as they are read  properly with the Read command later. You will need to  use the Restore command to point to the .Label that begins your Data statements. See the related  commands for more information and more examples.

See also: Read, Restore.

## Example

```blitzbasic
Print "Here we go!"; Restore to the start of the Data statements

Restore startData; Get the first number which is the total number of users

Read Users; Print them all!

For T = 1 To Users

Read firstname$

Read age

Read accuracy#

Read lastname$

Print firstname$ + " " + lastname$ + " is " + age + " years old with " + accuracy#  + " accuracy!"
