## Parameters

x = any positive number.

---

## Description

Natural logarithm of x. This is the inverse of Exp( ).

y = Log( x ) means y satifies x = Exp( y ).

The base of the natural logarithm is e = Exp(1) = 2.71828...

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Log example; NaN means "Not a Number", the numerical result is invalid.; NOTE: All logarithm functions are related. For example, there is no;       Log8 function in Blitz, but we can easily make one.

HidePointer

Print "Log8( -1 ) = " + Log8( -1 )

Print "Log8( 0  ) = " + Log8( 0 )

Print; ... and now some well behaved numbers...

x# = 1.0 / 4096.0   ; small positive number

For n = 1 To 15

Print "Log8( " + LSet( x, 13 ) + " ) = " + Log8( x )

x = 8 * x

Next

WaitKey()  :  End

Function Log8# ( x# )

Return Log( x ) / Log( 8 )

End Function
