# ReadPixelFast (x,y,[buffer])

## Parameters

x - y-coordinate of pixel

y - y-coordinate of pixel

buffer (optional) - name of buffer to read colour value from, e.g. BackBuffer()

---

## Description

Reads a color value from either the current buffer or the specified buffer,  and returns it.

The returned colour value is in the form of an integer than  contains the alpha, red, green and blue values of the pixel. 

IMPORTANT: 

You *must* use this command on a locked buffer, otherwise the command will  fail. See LockBuffer. 

Also, you must make sure that the coordinates that you are reading from are  valid, otherwise you will end up reading garbage values. 

WARNING: 

By not following the above advice, you may cause your computer to crash.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; ReadPixelFast/WritePixeFast Example; -----------------------------------

Graphics 640,480,16

Print "Press a key to read color values"

WaitKey(); Load and draw an image on to the screen - can be anything

pic=LoadImage("media/blitz_pic.bmp")

DrawImage pic,0,0 ; Initialise an array big enough to fit all the color information of the screen

Dim pix(GraphicsWidth(),GraphicsHeight()); Lock buffer before using ReadPixelFast

LockBuffer; Use ReadPixel to get all the color information of the screen

For y=0 To GraphicsHeight()

For x=0 To GraphicsWidth()

pix(x,y)=ReadPixelFast(x,y)

Next

Next; Lock buffer after using ReadPixelFast

UnlockBuffer

Cls

Locate 0,0

Print "Press a key to write pixels"

Print "Once this has finished, you can then press a key to end the program"

WaitKey(); Lock buffer before using WritePixelFast

LockBuffer; Use WritePixel to redraw the screen using the color information we got earlier

For y=0 To GraphicsHeight()

For x=0 To GraphicsWidth()

WritePixelFast x,y,pix(x,GraphicsHeight()-y) ; get y array value in backwards  order, to flip screen

Next

Next; Unlock buffer after using WritePixelFast

UnlockBuffer

WaitKey()
