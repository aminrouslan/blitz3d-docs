## Example

```blitzbasic
; TRUE example; Assign test a random number of 0 or 1

test= Rnd(0,1); TRUE is implied; This statement REALLY means: if test=1 is TRUE then proceed

If test=1 Then

Print "Test was valued at 1"

End If; Let's set test to be true

test=True; Pointlessly test it

If test=True Then

Print "Test is true"

End If
```
