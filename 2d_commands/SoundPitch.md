# SoundPitch sound_variable, hertz

## Parameters

sound_variable = any valid sound variable previously created with the LoadSound  command.

hertz = valid playback hertz speed (up to 44000 hertz).

---

## Description

Alters the pitch of a sound previously loaded with the LoadSound command. By changing the pitch, you can  often reuse sounds for different uses or to simulate a 'counting up/down' sound.  To make the sound 'higher pitched', increase the hertz. Conversely, decreasing the hertz will 'lower' the pitch. Note: this is in relation to the original hertz frequency of the sound.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Load the sound (11,000 hertz)

snd1Up = LoadSound("audiooneup.wav"); Play the sound normally

PlaySound snd1Up; Change the pitch UP and play it

SoundPitch snd1Up, 11000*2 ;twice original frequency

PlaySound snd1Up; Change the pitch down and play it

SoundPitch snd1Up, 11000/2 ;1/2 original frequency

PlaySound snd1Up
