## Parameters

src_x = source top left x location to begin copying from

src_y = source top left y location to begin copying from

src_width = width of source area to copy

src_height = height of source area to copy

dest_x = destination top left x location to copy to

dest_y = destination top left y location to copy to

src_buffer = handle to the source image buffer (optional)

```blitzbasic
; CopyRect Example; Turn on graphics mode

Graphics 800,600,16; create a blank image

gfxBlank=CreateImage (300,300); Fill the screen with random boxes in random colors

For t = 1 To 1000

Rect Rand(800),Rand(600),Rand(100),Rand(100),Rand(0,1) 

Color Rand(255),Rand(255),Rand(255)

Next; Wait a couple of seconds so the user can see it

Delay 2000; Copy graphics randomly from the front buffer to the blank image

CopyRect Rand(800),Rand(600),300,300,0,0,FrontBuffer(),ImageBuffer(gfxBlank); Clear the screen, draw the copied to image, wait for user to hit a key
