# ResizeImage image,width#,height#

## Parameters

image = file handle for previously loaded image

width# = new width in pixels

height# = new height in pixels

---

## Description

Similar to ScaleImage, but uses pixel values  instead of percentages. Use this command to resize an image previously loaded  with LoadImage or LoadAnimImage.

This is NOT intended for REAL TIME scaling of images! Precalculate your images  before running your program, or you will likely see massively slow renderings  of graphics.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; ResizeImage example; Set Graphics Mode

Graphics 800,600,16; Randomize the random seed

SeedRnd MilliSecs(); Load an image to tile (your location might vary)

gfxBall=LoadImage("C:Program FilesBlitz Basicsamplesall.bmp"); Size it randomly from 300 to -300 both x and y

ResizeImage gfxBall,Rnd(-300,300),Rnd(-300,300); Wait for ESC to hit

While Not KeyHit(1)

DrawImage gfxball,Rnd(800),Rnd(600)
