# BackBuffer()

## Parameters

None.

---

## Description

This is a value usually used with SETBUFFER  to denote the secondary non-visible drawing buffer called the Back Buffer. In  MOST gaming situations, you will want to be using the BackBuffer() for drawing  operations then using Flip to bring that buffer to the FrontBuffer() where it can be seen. There are  other uses for the command, but this is the biggie. See SETBUFFER for more info, and check out the example.  Once again - if you set drawing operations to the BackBuffer() you will NOT  see any of them until you call FLIP.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Flip/Backbuffer()/Rect Example; Set Graphics Mode

Graphics 640,480; Go double buffering

SetBuffer BackBuffer(); Setup initial locations for the box

box_x = -20 ; negative so it will start OFF screen

box_y = 100

While Not KeyHit(1)

Cls ; Always clear screen first

Rect box_x,box_y,20,20,1 ; Draw the box in the current x,y location

Flip ; Flip it into view

box_x = box_x + 1 ; Move the box over one pixel

If box_x = 640 Then box_x=-20 ; If it leaves the Right edge, reset its x location
