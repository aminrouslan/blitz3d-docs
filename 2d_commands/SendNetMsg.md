# SendNetMsg type,data$,from,to,reliable

## Parameters

type = value 1-99

data$ = string containing message to send

from = player ID of the sender

to = player ID of the recipient (0=broadcast)

reliable = flag for sending message reliably

---

## Description

First off, this ONLY works when you have joined a network game via StartNetGame or JoinNetGame  and you have created a player via CreateNetPlayer  (you must create a player, even if it is just to lurk).

This is probably the most complicated of the networking commands. This what  you use to actually send a message to one or all of the players on the network  game. The other players will use RecvNetMsg()  to intercept your message. 

The TYPE parameter is a number from 1 to 99. These values are denoted as 'user  messages'.

The Data$ parameter is the actual string that contains the message you want  to send. Helpful to know that in order to keep traffic low, you will want to  combine details of a message into a single message instead of sending multiple  messages with a single element. For example, you might want to send X, Y, and  FRAME in a single string like "200,100,4" and parse it out at the recipient's  end.

FROM is the player's ID that is sending the message. This is the value returned  from the CreateNetPlayer() command.

TO is the player's ID you wish to send the message to. A default value of 0  will broadcast to ALL players.

The RELIABLE flag will put a priority on the message and it will ensure there  is no packet loss in the delivery. However, it is at least 3 times slower than  a regular non-reliable message.

The example requires that you run it on the local machine while the remote computer  runs the example in the RecvNetMsg() command.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; SendNetMsg example; ------------------; Run this example on the local computer; run the example for RecvNetMsg() on a remote computer; Graphics mode with double buffering

Graphics 640,480,16

SetBuffer BackBuffer(); Create a network game with NO requester

joinStatus=HostNetGame("ShaneGame"); A type to hold all the player's information

Type multi

Field x

Field y

Field id

Field name$

Field xspeed

Field boxColor

End Type; make sure the game started ok...

If joinStatus=2 Then

Print "Hosted game started... "

Else

Print "Hosted game could not be started!"

End

End If; Create 5 local players using TYPEs

For t = 1 To 5; New type instance

player.multi = New Multi; Assign the ID field with the created player ID and name him

playerID=CreateNetPlayer("Player" + t); if the player was created ok ... assign some random parameters

If playerID <> 0 Then

Print "Player " + t + " has joined the game with ID=" + playerID

Else

Print "The player couldn't join! Aborting!"

End If

Next; We've got them all! Wait for a key

Print "All local players are joined! Press a key ..."

WaitKey(); Loop this routine

If playerx > 640 Or playerx < 0 Then 

playerxspeed=-playerxspeed

message$="Player ID #" + playerID + " hit a wall!"; Send a broadcast message if a player rebounds off the wall; this message will show up on the remote machine
