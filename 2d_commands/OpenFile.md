# OpenFile (filename$)

## Parameters

filename$ = any valid path and filename. The returned value is the filehandle  which is used by other file handling commands.

---

## Description

This command opens the designated file and prepares it to be updated. The  file must exists since this function will not create a new file.

By using FilePos and SeekFile the position within the file that is being read  or written can be determined and also changed. This allows a file to be read  and updated without having to make a new copy of the file or working through  the whole file sequentially. This could be useful if you have created a database  file and you want to find and update just a few records within it.

The file handle that is returned is an integer value that the operating system  uses to identify which file is to be read and written to and must be passed  to the functions such as ReadInt() and WriteInt().

Note extreme care needs to be exercised when updating files that contain strings  since these are not fixed in length.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Changing part of a file using OpenFile, SeekFile and WriteInt; Open/create a file to Write

fileout = WriteFile("mydata.dat"); Write the information to the file

WriteInt( fileout, 1 )

WriteInt( fileout, 2 )

WriteInt( fileout, 3 )

WriteInt( fileout, 4 )

WriteInt( fileout, 5 ); Close the file

CloseFile( fileout )

DisplayFile( "The file as originally written", mydata.dat" ); Open the file and change the Third Integer

file = OpenFile("mydata.dat")

SeekFile( file, 8 ) ; Move to the third integer in the file

WriteInt( file, 9999 ) ; Replace the original value with 9999

CloseFile( file )

DisplayFile( "The file after being midified", "mydata.dat" )

WaitKey(); **** Function Definitions follow ****; Read the file and print it

Function DisplayFile( Tittle$, Filename$ )

Print tittle$

filein = ReadFile( Filename$ )

While Not Eof( filein )

Number = ReadInt( filein )

Print Number

Wend

CloseFile( filein )

Print

End Function
