# ChannelVolume channel_handle, volume#

## Parameters

channel_handle = variable assigned to the channel when played

volume# = volume level floating value between 0 and 1

---

## Description

While SoundVolume happily changes the volume  of the entire program, this command will let you adjust volume rates on a 'per  channel' basis. Extremely useful.

The volume value is a floating point value between 0 and 1 (0 = silence, .5  = half volume, 1= full volume). You can do other cool stuff like ChannelPitch and ChannelPan  too!
