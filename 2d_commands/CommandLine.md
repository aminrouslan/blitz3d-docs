# CommandLine$()

## Parameters

None.

---

## Description

If you are writing an application or game that allows starting with special  parameters on the command line, you can use this command to retrieve the parameters.

For example, you might want to start the program with a debug variable set so  you can track stuff during execution. So, you could offer the ability to run  the executatble with a /debug parameter. If they execute the program with the  parameter, then you can set a flag inside your game.

To simulate the command line passing in the editor, select PROGRAM->PROGRAM  COMMAND LINE from the pulldowns and enter a value to be passed at runtime. 

See the example.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; CommandLine$() Example; Be sure to use PROGRAM->PROGRAM COMMAND LINE from the; pull down and put /debug in there to test with.

a$=CommandLine$()

If a$="/debug" Then 

Print "Debug mode is on!"

debug=1

Else

Print "No debugging activated."

debug=0

End If
```
