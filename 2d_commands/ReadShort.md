# ReadShort (filehandle/stream)

## Parameters

filehandle/stream = a valid variable set with the OpenFile, ReadFile command,  or OpenTCPStream (v1.52+)

The value returned is an integer in the range 0-65535.

---

## Description

Once you've opened a disk file (or stream) for reading, use this command  to read a single short integer (16bit) value from the file. Note, each value  written uses 2 bytes of disk space and is written least significant byte first.  Reading beyond the end of file does not result in an error, but each value read  will be zero.

Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Reading and writing a file using ReadShort and WriteShort functions; Initialise some variables for the example

Int1% = 10 ; store 10

Int2% = 365 ; store 365

Int3% = 32767 ; 32767 is the largest positive Short Integer Value in BlitzBasic  )

Int4% = -32768 ; -32768 the largest negative Short Integer Value in BlitzBasic  ); Open a file to write to

fileout = WriteFile("mydata.dat"); Write the information to the file

WriteShort( fileout, Int1 )

WriteShort( fileout, Int2 )

WriteShort( fileout, Int3 )

WriteShort( fileout, Int4 ); Close the file

CloseFile( fileout ); Open the file to Read

filein = ReadFile("mydata.dat")

Read1 = ReadShort( filein )

Read2 = ReadShort( filein )

Read3 = ReadShort( filein )

Read4 = ReadShort( filein ); Close the file once reading is finished

CloseFile( filein )

Print "Short Integer Data Read From File - mydata.dat "

Print Read1

Print Read2

Print Read3

Print Read4
