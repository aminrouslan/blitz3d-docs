# ReadFloat (filehandle/stream)

## Parameters

filehandle/stream = a valid variable set with the OpenFile, ReadFile command,  or OpenTCPStream (v1.52+) The value returned is a floating point number.

---

## Description

Once you've opened a disk file (or stream) for reading, use this command  to read a single floating point number from the file. Note, each value written  uses 4 bytes of space. Reading beyond the end of file does not result in an  error, but each value read will be zero.

Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Reading and writing a file using ReadFloat and WriteFloat functions; Initialise some variables for the example

Num1# = 10.5 ; store 10.5

Num2# = 365.25 ; store 365.25

Num3# = 32767.123 ; 32767.123 is the largest positive Short Integer Value in  BlitzBasic )

Num4# = -32768.123 ; -32768.123 the largest negative Short Integer Value in  BlitzBasic ); Open a file to write to

fileout = WriteFile("mydata.dat"); Write the information to the file

WriteFloat( fileout, Num1 )

WriteFloat( fileout, Num2 )

WriteFloat( fileout, Num3 )

WriteFloat( fileout, Num4 ); Close the file

CloseFile( fileout ); Open the file to Read

filein = ReadFile("mydata.dat")

Read1# = ReadFloat( filein )

Read2# = ReadFloat( filein )

Read3# = ReadFloat( filein )

Read4# = ReadFloat( filein ); Close the file once reading is finished

CloseFile( filein )

Print "Floating Point Data Read From File - mydata.dat "

Print Read1

Print Read2

Print Read3

Print Read4
