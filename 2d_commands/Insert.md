# Insert

## Parameters

None.

## Description

I'm not sure the practical usage of this command, but basically, you can  control where you INSERT the current TYPE object into  the TYPE collection. When you create a new Type object with the NEW command, it is automatically appended to the END of  the collection. Using INSERT along with BEFORE and AFTER (and electively FIRST  and LAST) to put the Type object exactly where you want  it. Sounds confusing - and chances are likely you'll never need this ability.  But its here if you need it. Check the example.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; INSERT example; Define a CHAIR type with a created field to track what order it was created  in.

Type CHAIR

Field created

End Type ; Create 10 chairs, setting created field to the order of creation

For t = 1 To 10

room.chair= New Chair

room\created = t

Next; Make a NEW chair (the 11th) 

room.chair= New Chair; Set its created value to 11

room\created=11; Now, let's insert this chair BEFORE the first one in the collection

Insert room Before First Chair; Let's iterate through all the chairs, and show their creation order

For room.chair = Each chair

Print room\created

Next
```
