## Example

```blitzbasic
; ReadDir/NextFile$/CloseDir example; Define what folder to start with ...

folder$="C:"; Open up the directory, and assign the handle to myDir

myDir=ReadDir(folder$); Let's loop forever until we run out of files/folders to list!

Repeat; Assign the next entry in the folder to file$

file$=NextFile$(myDir); If there isn't another one, let's exit this loop

If file$="" Then Exit; Use FileType to determine if it is a folder (value 2) or a file and print  results

If FileType(folder$+"\"+file$) = 2 Then

Print "Folder:" + file$

Else

Print "File:" + file$

End If

Forever; Properly close the open folder

CloseDir myDir; We're done!

Print "Done listing files!"
