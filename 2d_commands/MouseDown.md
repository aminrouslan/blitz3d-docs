# MouseDown (button)

## Parameters

button = 1: Left Button, 2: Right Button, 3: Middle Button

## Description

This command (and its counterparts KeyDown and JoyDown) is used to detect if a mouse button is being  held down. You must check for each mouse button independantly with its corresponding  number (unlike KeyDown which returns WHICH key is being held down). Also see MouseHit.

While Not KeyHit(1)

button$="No"

If MouseDown(1) Then button$="Left"

If MouseDown(2) Then button$="Right"

If MouseDown(3) Then button$="Middle"

Print button$ + " mouse button pressed!"
