# WriteShort (filehandle/stream, myinteger)

## Parameters

filehandle/stream = a valid variable set with the OpenFile, WriteFile command,  or OpenTCPStream (v1.52+)

myinteger = an integer variable (a floating point number can be used but this  will be converted to an integer before saving so only the integer part will  be saved)

---

## Description

Once you've opened a disk file (or stream) for writing, use this command  to write a single short integer (16 bit) value to the file. Note, each value  written uses 2 bytes and is written least significant byte first. The range  of the value saved is 0-65535

Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Reading and writing a file using ReadShort and WriteShort functions; Initialise some variables for the example

Int1% = 10 ; store 10

Int2% = 365 ; store 365

Int3% = 32767 ; 32767 is the largest positive Short Integer Value in BlitzBasic  )

Int4% = -32768 ; -32768 the largest negative Short Integer Value in BlitzBasic  ); Open a file to write to

fileout = WriteFile("mydata.dat"); Write the information to the file

WriteShort( fileout, Int1 )

WriteShort( fileout, Int2 )

WriteShort( fileout, Int3 )

WriteShort( fileout, Int4 ); Close the file

CloseFile( fileout ); Open the file to Read

filein = ReadFile("mydata.dat")

Read1 = ReadShort( filein )

Read2 = ReadShort( filein )

Read3 = ReadShort( filein )

Read4 = ReadShort( filein ); Close the file once reading is finished

CloseFile( filein )

Print "Short Integer Data Read From File - mydata.dat "

Print Read1

Print Read2

Print Read3

Print Read4
