# ChannelPan channel_handle, pan#

## Parameters

channel_handle = variable assigned to the channel when played

pan# = panning floating value to denote channel playback

## Description

When you want to do real sound panning effects, this is the command you'll  use. This will allow you to pan the sound channels on a 'per channel' basis  between the left and right speakers. This command makes it very easy to produce  some really killer stereophonic effects!

The pan value is between -1 and 1 with 0 being perfect center. -1 is full left,  and 1 is full right. To make it somewhere in between, try -.5 for 50% left or  .75 for 75% right.
