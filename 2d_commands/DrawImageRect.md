# DrawImageRect image,x,y,rect_x,rect_y,rect_width,rect_height,[frame]

## Parameters

image = variable holding the image handle

x = x location on the screen to draw the image

y = y location on the screen to draw the image

rect_x = starting x location within the image to draw

rect_y = starting y location within the image to draw

rect_width = the height of the area to draw

rect_height = the width of the area to draw

frame = optional frame number of image to draw

## Description

This command will let you draw a rectangular PORTION of an image to the  designated location on the screen. The transparent/masked portions of the original  image will be drawn transparent, just as you normally would draw an image.

This is handy if you are doing something like revealing part of a screen when  the player uncovers something (think QIX). You could load the 'picture' into  an image, then when the player clears a rectangular region, you could paste  that portion of the final image onto the playfield. If you want to draw the  image portion with no transparency or mask, use  DrawBlockRect instead.
