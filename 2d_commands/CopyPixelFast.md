# CopyPixelFast src_x,src_y,src_buffer,dest_x,dest_y,[dest_buffer]

## Parameters

src_x - x-coordinate of source pixel to copy from

src_y - y-coordinate of source pixel to copy from

src_buffer - name of buffer to copy from, e.g. ImageBuffer()

dest_x - x-coordinate of destination pixel to copy to

dest_y - y-coordinate of destination pixel to copy to

dest_buffer (optional) - name of buffer to copy to, e.g. BackBuffer()

---

## Description

IMPORTANT: 

You *must* use this command on a locked buffer, otherwise the command will  fail. See LockBuffer. 

Also, you must make sure that the coordinates that you are copying from and  to are valid, otherwise you will end up overwriting other areas of memory. 

WARNING: 

By not following the above advice, you may cause your computer to crash. 

See also: CopyPixel.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; CopyPixel/CopyPixelFast Example; -------------------------------

Graphics 640,480,16

Print "Press a key to use CopyPixel to copy the top half of an image to the  frontbuffer"

WaitKey(); Load an image - can be anything

pic=LoadImage("media/blitz_pic.bmp"); Use CopyPixel to copy the top half of the image to the frontbuffer

For y=0 To ImageHeight(pic)/2

For x=0 To ImageWidth(pic)

CopyPixel x,y,ImageBuffer(pic),x,y

Next

Next

Locate 0,GraphicsHeight()/2

Print "Press a key to use CopyPixelFast to copy the bottom half of the image"

Print "Once this has finished, you can then press a key to end the program"

WaitKey(); Lock buffer before using CopyPixelFast

LockBuffer; Use CopyPixelFast to copy the bottom half of the image to the frontbuffer

For y=0 To (ImageHeight(pic)/2)+ImageHeight(pic)

For x=0 To ImageWidth(pic)

CopyPixelFast x,y,ImageBuffer(pic),x,y

Next

Next; Unlock buffer after using CopyPixelFast

UnlockBuffer
