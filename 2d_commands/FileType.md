# FileType (filename$)

## Parameters

filename$ = any valid variable with path/filename

---

## Description

This command checks the filename you pass and determines if it exists and  whether or not it is a valid filename or if it is a directory. Here are the  values it returns:

1 = The filename exists

0 = The filename doesn't exist

2 = The filename is not a file - but a directory

Use this to validate that a file exists before you do something to it.
