# Eof (filehandle/stream)

## Parameters

filehandle/stream = a valid variable set with the OpenFile, ReadFile command,  or OpenTCPStream (v1.52+)

---

## Description

Checks to see if the End of File of an opened file or stream has been reached.  Use this to determine if you should continue to pull more information from a  file/stream or not. Use this to read a text file of unknown length (say a README.TXT)  and display it. See example.

Eof returns 1 if eof has been reached or, in the case of a TCP stream, the stream  has been 'nicely' closed.

Eof returns -1 if something has gone wrong during stream processing.

Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; Eof sample

file$="c:autoexec.bat"

filein = ReadFile(file$)

Print "Here is your Autoexec.bat file ..."; Loop this until we reach the end of file

While Not Eof(filein)

Print ReadLine$(filein)
