# Int( value )

## Parameters

value = a number, or a string which represents a number

---

## Description

Converts the value to the nearest integer.

This is the same as Blitz's automatic type conversion.

So the two commands...

n = value

n = Int( value )... do exactly the same thing when n is an integer variable.

If Int is applied to a string it converts as much as possible:

Int( "10" ) ........ result is 10

Int( "3.7" ) ....... result is 3, stops at "." which can't be part of an integer

Int( "junk3" ) .... result is 0, stops at "j"

Int converts floating point numbers by rounding to the nearest integer.

NOTE: This is not the traditional meaning of Int in Basic.

What about numbers exactly halfway between integers?

The rounding is to the nearest even integer:

Int( 2.5 ) ... produces 2

Int( 3.5 ) ... produces 4

See also Floor and Ceil for other types of rounding.
