# Str variable/value

## Parameters

variable/value = numeric value or variable

---

## Description

Use this command to transform an numeric value to a string value for use  with string commands. Blitz prints numeric values just fine, but should you  want to do functions like LEFT$, you'll need to convert  your numeric variable to a string variable. Note: during the conversion, all  6 decimal places will be represented on floating point number conversions.

If you wish to convert from a string to a number, there is no equivalent Val command.  Instead, simply assign the string variable into a numeric variable, and Blitz will implicitly convert it.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; STR example

num#=2.5

mynum$=str num#

Print mynum$
```
