# PauseChannel channel_handle

## Parameters

channel_handle = variable assigned to the channel when played

---

## Description

When you are playing a sound channel, there may come a time you wish to  pause the sound for whatever reason (like to play another sound effect). This  command does this - and the channel can be resumed with the ResumeChannel command. You can use StopChannel to actually halt the sound. This works  with any channel playback (WAV, MP3, MIDI, etc.).
