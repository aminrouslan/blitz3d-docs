# EntityShininess Entity, Shininess#

## Parameters

Entity - entity handle

Shininess# - shininess of entity

---

## Description

Sets the specular shininess of an entity.

The shininess# value should be a floting point number in the range 0-1. The default shininess setting is 0. 

Shininess is how much brighter certain areas of an object will appear to be when a light is shone directly at them. 

Setting a shininess value of 1 for a medium to high poly sphere, combined  with the creation of a light shining in the direction of it, will give it the  appearance of a shiny snooker ball.
