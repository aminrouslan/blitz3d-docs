# TurnEntity entity,pitch#,yaw#,roll#,[,global]

## Parameters

entity - name of entity to be rotated

pitch# - angle in degrees that entity will be pitched

yaw# - angle in degrees that entity will be yawed

roll# - angle in degrees that entity will be rolled

global (optional) -

---

## Description

Turns an entity relative to its current orientation.

Pitch is the same as the x angle of an entity, and is equivalent to tilting forward/backwards.

Yaw is the same as the y angle of an entity, and is equivalent to turning left/right.

Roll is the same as the z angle of an entity, and is equivalent to tilting left/right.

SetBuffer BackBuffer()

camera=CreateCamera()

light=CreateLight()

cone=CreateCone( 32 )

PositionEntity cone,0,0,5

While Not KeyDown( 1 ); Reset turn values - otherwise, the cone will not stop turning!

pitch#=0

yaw#=0

roll#=0; Change movement values depending on the key pressed

If KeyDown( 208 )=True Then pitch#=-1 

If KeyDown( 200 )=True Then pitch#=1

If KeyDown( 203 )=True Then yaw#=-1

If KeyDown( 205 )=True Then yaw#=1

If KeyDown( 45 )=True Then roll#=-1

If KeyDown( 44 )=True Then roll#=1; Move sphere using movement values
