## Parameters

brush - brush handle

alpha# - alpha level of brush

---

## Description

Sets the alpha level of a brush.

The alpha# value should be in the range  0-1. The default brush alpha setting is 1. 

The alpha level is how transparent an entity is. A value of 1 will mean the  entity is non-transparent, i.e. opaque. A value of 0 will mean the entity is  completely transparent, i.e. invisible. Values between 0 and 1 will cause varying  amount of transparency accordingly, useful for imitating the look of objects  such as glass and ice. 

An BrushAlpha value of 0 is especially useful as Blitz3D will not render  entities with such a value, but will still involve the entities in collision  tests. This is unlike HideEntity, which doesn't  involve entities in collisions.
