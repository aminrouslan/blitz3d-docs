# MoveEntity entity,x#,y#,z#

## Parameters

entity - name of entity to be moved

x# - x amount that entity will be moved by

y# - y amount that entity will be moved by

z# - z amount that entity will be moved by

---

## Description

Moves an entity relative to its current position and orientation.

What this means is that an entity will move in whatever direction it is facing. So for example if you have an game character is upright when first loaded into Blitz3D and it remains upright (i.e. turns left or right only), then moving it by a z amount will always see it move forward or backward, moving it by a y amount will always see it move up or down, and moving it by an x amount will always see it strafe.

; MoveEntity Example; ------------------

Graphics3D 640,480

SetBuffer BackBuffer()

camera=CreateCamera()

light=CreateLight()

cone=CreateCone( 32 ); Move cone in front of camera, so we can see it to begin with

MoveEntity cone,0,0,10 

While Not KeyDown( 1 ); Reset movement values - otherwise, the cone will not stop!

x#=0

y#=0

z#=0; Change rotation values depending on the key pressed

If KeyDown( 203 )=True Then x#=-0.1

If KeyDown( 205 )=True Then x#=0.1

If KeyDown( 208 )=True Then y#=-0.1

If KeyDown( 200 )=True Then y#=0.1

If KeyDown( 44 )=True Then z#=-0.1

If KeyDown( 30 )=True Then z#=0.1; Move cone using movement values

MoveEntity cone,x#,y#,z#; If spacebar pressed then rotate cone by random amount

If KeyHit( 57 )=True Then RotateEntity cone,Rnd( 0,360 ),Rnd( 0,360 ),Rnd(  0,360 )
