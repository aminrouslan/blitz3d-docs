# AddTriangle ( surface,v0,v1,v2 )

## Parameters

surface - surface handle

v0 - index number of first vertex of triangle

v1 - index number of second vertex of triangle

v2 - index number of third vertex of triangle

---

## Description

Adds a triangle to a surface and returns the triangle's index number, starting  from 0.

The v0, v1 and v2 parameters are the index numbers of the vertices  created using AddVertex. 

Depending on how the vertices are arranged, then the triangle will only be  visible from a certain side. Imagine that a triangle's vertex points are like  dot-to-dot pattern, each numbered v0, v1, v2. If these dots, starting from v0,  through to V2, form a clockwise pattern relative to the viewer, then the triangle  will be visible. If these dots form an anti-clockwise pattern relative to the  viewer, then the triangle will not be visible. 

The reason for having one-sided triangles is that it reduces the amount of  triangles that need to be rendered when one side faces the side of an object  which won't be seen (such as the inside of a snooker ball). However, if you  wish for a triangle to be two-sided, then you can either create two triangles,  using the same set of vertex numbers for both but assigning them in opposite  orders, or you can use CopyEntity and FlipMesh together.

mesh = CreateMesh()

surf = CreateSurface(mesh)

v0 = AddVertex (surf, -5,-5,0,  0  ,0)

v1 = AddVertex (surf,  5,-5,0,  1  ,0)

v2 = AddVertex (surf,  0, 5,0,  0.5,1)

tri = AddTriangle (surf,v0,v2,v1)

cam = CreateCamera()

MoveEntity cam, 0,0,-7
