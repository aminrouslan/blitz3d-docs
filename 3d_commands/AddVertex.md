# AddVertex ( surface,x#,y#,z#[,u#][,v#][,w#] )

## Parameters

surface - surface handle

x# - x coordinate of vertex

y# - y coordinate of vertex

z# - z coordinate of vertex

u# (optional) - u texture coordinate of vertex

v# (optional) - v texture coordinate of vertex

w# (optional) - w texture coordinate of vertex - not used, included for future expansion

## Description

Adds a vertex to the specified surface and returns the vertices' index number,  starting from 0.

x,y,z are the geometric coordinates of the vertex, and u,v,w are texture mapping coordinates.

A vertex is a point in 3D space which is used to connect edges of a triangle together. Without any vertices, you can't have any triangles. At least three  vertices are needed to create one triangle; one for each corner. 

The optional u, v and w parameters allow you to specify texture coordinates for a vertex, which will determine how any triangle created using those vertices will be texture mapped. The u, v and w parameters specified will take effect on both texture coordinate sets (0 and 1). This works on the following basis: 

The top left of an image has the uv coordinates 0,0. 

The top right has coordinates 1,0

The bottom right is 1,1.

The bottom left 0,1. 

Thus, uv coordinates for a vertex correspond to a point in the image. For example, coordinates 0.9,0.1 would be near the upper right corner of the image. 

So now imagine you have a normal equilateral triangle. By assigning the bottom left vertex a uv coordinate of 0,0, the bottom right a coordinate of 1,0 and the top centre 0.5,1, this will texture map the triangle with an image that fits it.

When adding a vertex its default color is 255,255,255,255.
