More info about the optional parameters: 

speed# - a negative speed will play the animation backwards. 

sequence - Initially, an entity loaded with LoadAnimMesh  will have a single animation sequence. More sequences can be added using either LoadAnimSeq or AddAnimSeq.  Animation sequences are numbered 0,1,2...etc. 

transition# - A value of 0 will cause an instant 'leap' to the first frame,  while values greater than 0 will cause a smooth transition.
