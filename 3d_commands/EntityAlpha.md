# EntityAlpha entity,alpha#

## Parameters

Entity - entity handle

Alpha# - alpha level of entity

---

## Description

Sets the entity alpha level of an entity.

The alpha# value should be in a floating point value in the range 0-1. The default entity alpha setting is 1. 

The alpha level is how transparent an entity is. A value of 1 will mean the entity is opaque. A value of 0 will mean the entity is completely transparent, i.e. invisible. Values between 0 and 1 will cause varying amount of transparency. This is useful for imitating the look of objects such as glass and other translucent materials. 

An EntityAlpha value of 0 is especially useful as Blitz3D will not render entities with such a value, but will still involve the entities in collision tests. This is unlike HideEntity, which doesn't involve entities in collisions.

Alpha#=1

While Not KeyDown( 1 ); Change alpha value depending on key pressed

If alpha#<0.01 Then alpha# = 0

If alpha#>1 Then alpha# = 1

If KeyDown( 2 )=True And Alpha#>0 Then Alpha#=Alpha#-0.01

If KeyDown( 3 )=True And alpha#<1 Then Alpha#=Alpha#+0.01; Set entity alpha value
