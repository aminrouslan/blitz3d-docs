# PaintEntity entity,brush

## Parameters

entity - entity handle

brush - brush handle

---

## Description

Paints a entity with a brush.

The reason for using PaintEntity to apply  specific properties to a entity using a brush rather than just using EntityTexture,  EntityColor, EntityShininess etc, is that you can pre-define one brush, and  then paint entities over and over again using just the one command rather than  lots of separate ones.
