# Windowed3D()

## Parameters

None.

---

## Description

Windowed3D returns true if the host machine's selected graphics card is capable of rendering 3D graphics in a window using the current desktop colour depth.

This mainly concerns older graphics cards, some of which may not be able to render 3D in a window at all, while others maybe be able to only render in a window if the user's desktop is set to a certain colour depth such as 16.

Print "Windowed mode!"

Else

Graphics3D 640, 480, 0, 1

Print "Full screen modes only!"

EndIf
