# LoadMesh(filename$,[Parent])

## Parameters

Filename$ - Name of the file containing the model to load.

Parent (optional) - Specify an entity to act as a Parent to the loaded mesh.

---

## Description

LoadMesh, as the name suggests, Loads a mesh from an .X, .3DS or .B3D file (Usually created in advance by one of a number of 3D model creation packages) and returns the mesh handle.

Any hierarchy and animation information in the file will be ignored. Use LoadAnimMesh to maintain hierarchy and  animation information.

The optional parent parameter allows you to specify a parent entity for the mesh so that when the parent is moved the child mesh will move with it. However, this relationship is one way;  applying movement commands to the child will not affect the parent. 

Specifying a parent entity will still result in the mesh being created at position 0,0,0 rather than at the parent entity's position.
