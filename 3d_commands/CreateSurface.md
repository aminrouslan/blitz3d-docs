# CreateSurface ( mesh[,brush] )

## Parameters

mesh - mesh handle

brush (optional) - brush handle

---

## Description

Creates a surface attached to a mesh and returns the surface's handle.

Surfaces are sections of mesh which are then used to attach triangles to. You  must have at least one surface per mesh in order to create a visible mesh, however  you can use as many as you like. Splitting a mesh up into lots of sections allows  you to affect those sections individually, which can be a lot more useful than  if all the surfaces are combined into just one.

SetBuffer BackBuffer()

mesh = CreateMesh()

surf = CreateSurface(mesh)

v0 = AddVertex (surf, -5,-5,0,  0  ,0)

v1 = AddVertex (surf,  5,-5,0,  1  ,0)

v2 = AddVertex (surf,  0, 5,0,  0.5,1)

tri = AddTriangle (surf,v0,v2,v1)

cam = CreateCamera()

MoveEntity cam, 0,0,-7
