# AntiAlias

## Parameters

enable - True to enable fullscreen antialiasing, False to disable.

The default AntiAlias mode is False.

---

## Description

Enables or disables fullscreen antialiasing.

Fullscreen antialiasing is a technique used to smooth out the entire screen,  so that jagged lines are made less noticeable.

Some 3D cards have built-in support for fullscreen antialiasing, which should  allow you to enable the effect without much slowdown. However, for cards without  built-in support for fullscreen antialiasing, enabling the effect may cause  severe slowdown.
