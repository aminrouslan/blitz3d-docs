# TFormNormal x#, y#, z#, source_entity, dest_entity

## Parameters

x#, y#, z# = components of a vector in 3d space

source_entity = handle of source entity, or 0 for 3d world

dest_entity = handle of destination entity, or 0 for 3d world

---

## Description

Transforms between coordinate systems. After using TFormNormal the new

components can be read with TFormedX(), TFormedY() and TFormedZ().

This is exactly the same as TFormVector but with one added feature.

After the transformation the new vector is 'normalized', meaning it

is scaled to have length 1.

For example, suppose the result of TFormVector is (1,2,2).

This vector has length Sqr( 1*1 + 2*2 + 2*2 ) = Sqr( 9 ) = 3.

This means TFormNormal would produce ( 1/3, 2/3, 2/3 ).

## Example

```blitzbasic
; TFormNormal example

Graphics3D 640, 480; Just a quick demonstration of the 'normalization' feature.

TFormNormal 1,2,2, 0,0    ;  transform from world to world; The transformation from world to world does nothing.; But afterward the vector (1,2,2) is divided by the length 3.

message$ = "The normalized vector is  ( "

message = message + TFormedX() + ",  " + TFormedY() + ",  " + TFormedZ() + " )"
