# FlipMesh mesh

## Parameters

mesh - mesh handle

## Description

Flips all the triangles in a mesh.

This is useful for a couple of reasons.  Firstly though, it is important to understand a little bit of the theory behind  3D graphics. A 3D triangle is represented by three points; only when these points  are presented to the viewer in a clockwise-fashion is the triangle visible.  So really, triangles only have one side. 

Normally, for example in the case of a sphere, a model's triangles face the  inside of the model, so it doesn't matter that you can't see them. However,  what about if you wanted to use the sphere as a huge sky for your world, i.e.  so you only needed to see the inside? In this case you would just use FlipMesh.

Another use for FlipMesh is to make objects two-sided, so you can see them from  the inside and outside if you can't already. In this case, you can copy the  original mesh using CopyEntity, specifying the  original mesh as the parent, and flip it using FlipMesh. You will now have two  meshes occupying the same space - this will make it double-sided, but beware,  it will also double the polygon count! 

The above technique is worth trying when an external modelling program has  exported a model in such a way that some of the triangles appear to be missing.
