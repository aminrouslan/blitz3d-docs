# UpdateWorld [anim_speed#]

## Parameters

anim_speed# (optional) - a master control for animation speed. Defaults  to 1.

---

## Description

Animates all entities in the world, and performs collision checking.

The  optional anim_speed# parameter allows you affect the animation speed of all  entities at once. A value of 1 will animate entities at their usual animation  speed, a value of 2 will animate entities at double their animation speed, and  so on.  

For best results use this command once per main loop, just before calling RenderWorld.
