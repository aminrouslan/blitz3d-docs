# TFormVector x#, y#, z#, source_entity, dest_entity

## Parameters

x#, y#, z# = components of a vector in 3d space

source_entity = handle of source entity, or 0 for 3d world

dest_entity = handle of destination entity, or 0 for 3d world

---

## Description

Transforms between coordinate systems. After using TFormVector the new

components can be read with TFormedX(), TFormedY() and TFormedZ(). 

See EntityX() for details about local coordinates.

Similar to TFormPoint, but operates on a vector. A vector can be thought of

as 'displacement relative to current location'.

For example, vector (1,2,3) means one step to the right, two steps up 

and three steps forward. 

This is analogous to PositionEntity and MoveEntity:

PositionEntity entity, x,y,z   ; put entity at point (x,y,z)

MoveEntity entity, x,y,z       ; add vector (x,y,z) to current position

## Example

```blitzbasic
; TFormVector example

Graphics3D 640, 480

p = CreatePivot()

PositionEntity p, 10, 20, 30   ; easy to visualize

TurnEntity p, -5, -15, 25      ; hard to visualize; Question: what would happen if we took one step 'forward'?; The local vector corresponding to one step forward is (0,0,1); in the pivot's local space. We need the global version.

TFormVector 0,0,1, p,0    ;  transform from pivot to world

message$ = "'One step forward' vector is  ( "

message = message + TFormedX() + ",  " + TFormedY() + ",  " + TFormedZ() + " )"

Text 70, 180, message; Now actually take the step. The new location should be; (10,20,30) plus the vector we just computed.

MoveEntity p, 0,0,1

message$ = "New location of pivot is  ( "

message = message + EntityX(p) + ",  "

message = message + EntityY(p) + ",  " + EntityZ(p) + " )"

Text 100, 210, message
