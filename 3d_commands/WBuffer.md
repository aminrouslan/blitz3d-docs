# WBuffer enable

## Parameters

enable - True to enable w-buffering rendering, False to disable.

The default  WBuffer mode is True for 16-bit colour mode, False for 24-bit and 32-bit.

## Description

Enables or disables w-buffering.

W-buffering is a technique used to draw 3D object in order of their depth -  i.e. the ones furthest away from the camera first, then the ones closer to the  camera, and so on. 

Normally, z-buffering is used to perform such a technique, but a z-buffer can  be slightly inaccurate in 16-bit colour mode, for which the level of precision  is less than in 24-bit or 32-bit colour modes. This means that in some situations,  objects will appear to overlap each other when they shouldn't and so on.

To compensate for this, you can use w-buffering. This is a slightly more accurate  technique than z-buffering, although it may be less compatible on some set-ups  than z-buffering.
