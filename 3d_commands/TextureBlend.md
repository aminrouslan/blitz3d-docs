# TextureBlend Texture, Blend

## Parameters

Texture - Texture handle.

Blend - Blend mode of texture.

0: Do not blend

1: No blend, or Alpha (alpha when texture loaded with alpha flag - not recommended  for multitexturing - see below)

2: Multiply (default)

3: Add

4: Dot3

5: Multiply 2

---

## Description

Sets the blending mode for a texture.

The texture blend mode determines how the texture will blend with the texture or polygon which is 'below' it. Texture 0 will blend with the polygons of the entity it is applied to. Texture 1 will blend with texture 0. Texture 2 will blend with texture 1. And so on.

Texture blending in Blitz effectively takes the highest order texture (the one with the highest index) and it blends with the texture below it, then that result to the texture directly below again, and so on until texture 0 which is blended with the polygons of the entity it is applied to and thus the world, depending on the 
EntityBlend
 of the object.

Each of the blend modes are identical to their 
EntityBlend
 counterparts.

In the case of multitexturing (more than one texture applied to an entity), it is not recommended you blend textures that have been loaded with the alpha flag, as this can cause unpredictable results on a variety of different graphics cards. 

Use 
EntityTexture
 to set the index number of a texture.
