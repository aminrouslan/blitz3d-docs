# GfxMode3DExists( width, height, depth)

## Parameters

width - the width of the display mode you want to check for

height - the height of the display mode you want to check for

depth - the depth of the display mode you want to check for

---

## Description

GfxMode3DExists will test to see whether the host machine's graphics card supports a certain video mode, as specified by the width, height and depth parameters, and also whether the specified video mode is 3D-capable.

If these answer to both these things is yes, then the command will return true, otherwise false.

Most, if not all modern graphics cards are 3D-capable in all available graphics modes, however a few older ones are 2D-capable only in certain video modes hence the need for GfxMode3DExists as well as GfxModeExists.
