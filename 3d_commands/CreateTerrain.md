# CreateTerrain ( grid_size[,parent] )

## Parameters

grid_size - no of grid squares along each side of terrain, and must be a  power of 2 value, e.g. 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.

parent (optional) - parent entity of terrain

---

## Description

Creates a terrain entity and returns its handle.

The terrain  extends from 0,0,0 to grid_size,1,grid_size. 

A terrain is a special type of polygon object that uses real-time level of  detail (LOD) to display landscapes which should theoretically consist of over  a million polygons with only a few thousand. The way it does this is by constantly  rearranging a certain amount of polygons to display high levels of detail close  to the viewer and low levels further away. 

This constant rearrangement of polygons is occasionally noticeable however,  and is a well-known side-effect of all LOD landscapes. This 'pop-in' effect  can be reduced in lots of ways though, as the other terrain help files will  go on to explain. 

The optional parent parameter allows you to specify a parent entity for the  terrain so that when the parent is moved the child terrain will move with it.  However, this relationship is one way; applying movement commands to the child  will not affect the parent. 

Specifying a parent entity will still result in the terrain being created  at position 0,0,0 rather than at the parent entity's position.
