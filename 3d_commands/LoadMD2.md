# LoadMD2 ( md2_file$[,parent] )

## Parameters

md2_file$ - filename of md2

parent (optional) - parent entity of md2

---

## Description

Loads an md2 entity and returns its handle.

An md2's texture has to be  loaded and applied to the md2 separately, otherwise the md2 will appear untextured. 

Md2's have their own set of animation commands, and will not work with normal  animation commands.  

The optional parent parameter allows you to specify a parent entity for the  md2 so that when the parent is moved the child md2 will move with it. However,  this relationship is one way; applying movement commands to the child will not  affect the parent. 

Specifying a parent entity will still result in the md2 being created at  position 0,0,0 rather than at the parent entity's position.
