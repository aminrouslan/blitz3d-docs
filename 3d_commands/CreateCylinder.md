# CreateCylinder ( [segments][,solid][,parent] )

## Parameters

segments (optional) - cylinder detail. Defaults to 8.

solid (optional) - true for a cylinder, false for a tube. Defaults to true.

parent (optional) - parent entity of cylinder

---

## Description

Creates a cylinder mesh/entity and returns its handle.

The cylinder will  be centred at 0,0,0 and will have a radius of 1. 

The segments value must be in the range 3-100 inclusive, although this is  only checked in debug mode. A common mistake is to leave debug mode off and  specify the parent parameter (usually an eight digit memory address) in the  place of the segments value. As the amount of polygons used to create a cylinder  is exponentially proportional to the segments value, this will result in Blitz  trying to create a cylinder with unimaginable amounts of polygons! Depending  on how unlucky you are, your computer may then crash. 

Example segments values (solid=true):

3: 8 polygons - a prism

8: 28 polygons - bare minimum amount of polygons for a cylinder

16: 60 polygons - smooth cylinder at medium-high distances

32: 124 polygons - smooth cylinder at close distances 

The optional parent parameter allow you to specify a parent entity for the  cylinder so that when the parent is moved the child cylinder will move with  it. However, this relationship is one way; applying movement commands to the  child will not affect the parent. 

Specifying a parent entity will still result in the cylinder being created  at position 0,0,0 rather than at the parent entity's position.
