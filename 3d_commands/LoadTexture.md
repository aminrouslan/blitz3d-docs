# LoadTexture ( file$[,flags] )

## Parameters

file$ - filename of image file to be used as texture

flags (optional) - texture flag:

1: Color (default)

2: Alpha

4: Masked

8: Mipmapped

16: Clamp U

32: Clamp V

64: Spherical environment map

128: Cubic environment map

256: Store texture in vram

512: Force the use of high color textures

---

## Description

Load a texture from an image file and returns the texture's handle.  Supported file formats include: BMP, PNG, TGA and JPG.  Only PNG and TGA support alpha.

The optional flags parameter allows you to apply certain effects to the texture. Flags can be added to combine two or more effects, e.g. 3 (1+2) = texture with colour and alpha maps.

See 
CreateTexture
 for more detailed descriptions of the texture flags.

Something to consider when applying texture flags to loaded textures is that the texture may have already had certain flags applied to it via the 
TextureFilter
 command. The default for the 
TextureFilter
 command is 9 (1+8), which is a coloured, mipmapped texture. This cannot be overridden via the flags parameter of the LoadTexture command - if you wish for the filters to be removed you will need to use the 
ClearTextureFilters
 command, which must be done after setting the graphics mode (setting the graphics mode restores the default texture filters).

See also: CreateTexture, LoadAnimTexture.
