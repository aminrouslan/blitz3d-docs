# GfxMode3D(mode)

## Parameters

mode - graphics mode number from 1 - CountGfxModes ()

---

## Description

GfxMode3D returns True if the specified graphics mode is 3D-capable.

GfxMode3D is generally used after obtaining a list of available display modes from a user's system via CountGfxModes (). You apply this to each mode in turn (or a selected mode) to see if you can enter 3D mode. If this returns False, calling Graphics3D () with this mode's details will fail!

If you don't wish to perform this check, the only Graphics3D call you can make with a guarantee of working on 99% of 3D graphics cards is 'Graphics3D 640, 480'. However, see GfxModeExists' gfx3d parameter for another method of performing this check.

## Example

```blitzbasic
For a = 1 To CountGfxModes ()

If GfxMode3D (a)

Print "Mode " + a + " is 3D-capable"

Else

Print "Mode " + a + " is NOT 3D-capable"

EndIf

Delay 100

Next
