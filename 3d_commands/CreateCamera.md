# CreateCamera ( [parent] )

## Parameters

parent (optional) - parent entity of camera

---

## Description

Creates a camera entity and returns its handle.

Without  at least one camera, you won't be able to see anything in your 3D world. With more than one camera, you will be to achieve effect such as  split-screen modes and rear-view mirrors. 

A camera can only render to the backbuffer. If you wish to display 3D  graphics on an image or a texture then copy the contents of the backbuffer  to the appropriate buffer. 

The optional parent parameter allow you to specify a parent entity for  the camera so that when the parent is moved the child camera will move with  it. However, this relationship is one way; applying movement commands to the  child will not affect the parent. 

Specifying a parent entity will still result in the camera being created  at position 0,0,0 rather than at the parent entity's position.
