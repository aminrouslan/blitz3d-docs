# AddMesh source_mesh,dest_mesh

## Parameters

source_mesh - source mesh handle

dest_mesh - destination mesh handle

---

## Description

Adds the source mesh to the destination mesh.

AddMesh works best with  meshes that have previously only had mesh commands used with them. 

So if you want to manipulate a mesh before adding it to another mesh, make  sure you use ScaleMesh, PositionMesh, PaintMesh etc rather than ScaleEntity,  PositionEntity, EntityTexture etc before using AddMesh. 

However, something to be aware of when using commands such as RotateMesh  is that all mesh commands work from a global origin of 0,0,0. Therefore it is  generally a good idea to scale and rotate a mesh before positioning it, otherwise  your mesh could end up in unexpected positions. Also, when using AddMesh, the  origin of the new all-in-one mesh will be set at 0,0,0. 

After using AddMesh, the original source_mesh will still exist, therefore  use FreeEntity to delete it if you wish to do so.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; AddMesh Example; ---------------

Graphics3D 640,480

SetBuffer BackBuffer()

camera=CreateCamera()

PositionEntity camera,0,0,-10

light=CreateLight()

RotateEntity light,90,0,0; Create tree mesh (upper half)

tree=CreateCone()

green_br=CreateBrush(0,255,0)

PaintMesh tree,green_br

ScaleMesh tree,2,2,2

PositionMesh tree,0,1.5,0; Create trunk mesh

trunk=CreateCylinder()

brown_br=CreateBrush(128,64,0)

PaintMesh trunk,brown_br

PositionMesh trunk,0,-1.5,0; Add trunk mesh to tree mesh, to form one whole tree

AddMesh trunk,tree; Free trunk mesh - we don't need it anymore

FreeEntity trunk
