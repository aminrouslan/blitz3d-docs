# GfxDriver3D(driver)

## Parameters

driver - display driver number to check, from 1 to CountGfxDrivers ()

---

## Description

GfxDriver3D returns True if the specified graphics driver is 3D-capable.

GfxDriver3D is generally used after obtaining a list of available graphics drivers from a user's system via CountGfxDrivers(). You apply this to each driver in turn (or a selected driver) to see if it is 3D-capable. If this returns False, the driver can not perform 3D operations.

On systems with more than one display driver, you can use this to check each for 3D capability before choosing one via the SetGfxDriver command.

## Example

```blitzbasic
For a = 1 To CountGfxDrivers ()

If GfxDriver3D (a)

Print GfxDriverName (a) + " is 3D-capable"

Else

Print GfxDriverName (a) + " is NOT 3D-capable"

EndIf

Delay 100
