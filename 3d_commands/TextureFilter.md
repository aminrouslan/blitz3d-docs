# TextureFilter match_text$,flags

## Parameters

match_text$ - text that, if found in texture filename, will activate certain  filters

flags - filter texture flags: 

1: Color

2: Alpha 

4: Masked 

8: Mipmapped 

16: Clamp U 

32: Clamp V 

64: Spherical reflection map 

128: 

256: Store texture in vram 

512: Force the use of high color textures

---

## Description

Adds a texture filter. Any textures loaded that contain the text specified  by match_text$ will have the provided flags added.

This is mostly of use when loading a mesh. 

By default, the following texture filter is used: 

TextureFilter "",1+8 

This means that all loaded textures will have color and be mipmapped by default.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; ClearTextureFilters and TextureFilter Example.; ----------------------------------------------

Const tex_color 	= 1		; Color texture

Const tex_alpha 	= 2		; Alpha texture (Include alpha channel data)

Const tex_mask 		= 4		; Masked texture (black is transparent)

Const tex_mipmap 	= 8		; Create texture mipmaps

Const tex_clampu 	= 16	; Restrict U texture coords from "bleeding over"

Const tex_clampv	= 32	; Restrict V texture coords from "bleeding over"

Const tex_envshpere	= 64	; Load texture as a spherical environment map

Const tex_vram 		= 256	; Force texture graphics to vram

Const tex_highcolor	= 512	; Forces texture graphics to be 32-bits per pixel

ClearTextureFilters; Add an alpha texture to the list of ; texture filters to apply to files; that have "_alpha" in their filenames.

TextureFilter "_alpha",tex_color + tex_alpha + tex_mipmap; Set appropriate texture flags for loading; suitable skybox textures from files named; something with "_skybox".

TextureFilter "_skybox", tex_color + tex_mipmap + tex_clampu + tex_clampv; Set the flags for loading a spherical refletction; map to apply to all "_refmap" files.

TextureFilter "_refmap", tex_color + tex_mipmap + tex_envshpere; Setup a texture filter to allow faster; (and easier) pixel manipulation on all; loaded "_fastblit" files.

TextureFilter "_fastblit", tex_color + tex_vram + tex_highcolor; This is where you would normally load your special; textures.; The next bit resets the texture filters to their; standard settings.
