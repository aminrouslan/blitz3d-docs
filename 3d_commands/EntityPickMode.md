# EntityPickMode entity,pick_geometry[,obscurer]

## Parameters

entity - entity handle

pick_geometry - type of geometry used for picking:

0: Unpickable (default)

1: Sphere (EntityRadius is used)

2: Polygon

3: Box (EntityBox is used)

obscurer (optional) - True to determine that the entity 'obscures' other entities  during an EntityVisible call. Defaults to True.

---

## Description

Sets the pick mode for an entity.

The optional obscurer parameter is used  with EntityVisible to determine just what can  get in the way of the line-of-sight between 2 entities. This allows some entities  to be pickable using the other pick commands, but to be ignored (i.e. 'transparent')  when using EntityVisible. So, its very much EntityVisible specific.

Please note that only Sphere and Box picking will work with Blitz3D sprites. For polygon picking, you will need a valid mesh.
