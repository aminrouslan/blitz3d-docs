# SpriteViewMode sprite,view_mode

## Parameters

sprite - sprite handle

view_mode - view_mode of sprite

1: fixed (sprite always faces camera - default)

2: free (sprite is independent of camera)

3: upright1 (sprite always faces camera, but rolls with camera as well, unlike  mode no.1)

4: upright2 (sprite always remains upright. Gives a 'billboard' effect. Good  for trees, spectators etc.)

---

## Description

Sets the view mode of a sprite.

The view mode determines how a sprite  alters its orientation in respect to the camera. This allows the sprite to in  some instances give the impression that it is more than two dimensional. 

In technical terms, the four sprite modes perform the following changes: 

1: Sprite changes its pitch and yaw values to face camera, but doesn't roll.

2: Sprite does not change either its pitch, yaw or roll values.

3: Sprite changes its yaw and pitch to face camera, and changes its roll value  to match cameras.

4: Sprite changes its yaw value to face camera, but not its pitch value, and  changes its roll value to match cameras. 

Note that if you use sprite view mode 2, then because it is independent from  the camera, you will only be able to see it from one side unless you use EntityFx  flag 16 with it to disable backface culling.
