# PaintMesh mesh,brush

## Parameters

mesh - mesh handle

brush - brush handle

---

## Description

Paints a mesh with a brush.

This has the effect of instantly altering  the visible appearance of the mesh, assuming the brush's properties are different  to what was was applied to the surface before. 

The reason for using PaintMesh to apply specific properties to a mesh using  a brush rather than just using EntityTexture, EntityColor, EntityShininess etc,  is that you can pre-define one brush, and then paint meshes over and over again  using just the one command rather than lots of separate ones.
