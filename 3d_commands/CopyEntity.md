# CopyEntity ( entity[,parent] )

## Parameters

entity - Entity Handle

parent (optional) - Entity that will act as Parent to the copy.

---

## Description

Creates a copy of an entity and returns the handle of the newly created copy. This is a new entity instance of an existing entity's mesh! Anything you do to the original Mesh (such as RotateMesh) will effect all the copies. Other properties (such as EntityColor, Position etc.) since they are 'Entity' properties, will be individual to the copy.

If a parent entity is specified, the copied entity will be created at the parent entity's position. Otherwise, it will be created at 0,0,0.
