## Description

Sets miscellaneous effects for an entity.

Flags can be added to combine  two or more effects. For example, specifying a flag of 3 (1+2) will result in  a full-bright and vertex-coloured brush.

Flag 32, to force alpha-blending, must be used in order to enable vertex alpha (see VertexColor).
