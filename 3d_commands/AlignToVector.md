## Parameters

entity - entity handle

vector_x# - vector x

vector_y# - vector y

vector_z# - vector z

axis - axis of entity that will be aligned to vector

1: x-axis

2: y-axis

3: z-axis

rate# (optional) - rate at which entity is aligned from current  orientation to vector orientation. Should be in the range 0 to 1, 0 for smooth  transition and 1 for 'snap' transition. Defaults to 1.
