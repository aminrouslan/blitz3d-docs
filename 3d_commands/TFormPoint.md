# TFormPoint x#, y#, z#, source_entity, dest_entity

## Parameters

x#, y#, z# = coordinates of a point in 3d space

source_entity = handle of source entity, or 0 for 3d world

dest_entity = handle of destination entity, or 0 for 3d world

---

## Description

Transforms between coordinate systems. After using TFormPoint the new

coordinates can be read with TFormedX(), TFormedY() and TFormedZ(). 

See EntityX() for details about local coordinates. 

Consider a sphere built with CreateSphere(). The 'north pole' is at (0,1,0).

At first, local and global coordinates are the same. As the sphere is moved, 

turned and scaled the global coordinates of the point change.

But it is always at (0,1,0) in the sphere's local space.

## Example

```blitzbasic
; TFormPoint example

Graphics3D 640, 480

s = CreateSphere()       ; center at (0,0,0)  north pole at (0,1,0)

MoveEntity s, 1,2,3      ; center at (1,2,3)  north pole at (1,2+1,3)  

ScaleEntity s, 10,10,10  ; center at (1,2,3)  north pole at (1,2+10,3); Now verify that the north pole is at (1,12,3) in the 3d world

TFormPoint 0,1,0, s,0    ; north pole transformed from sphere to world

message$ = "North pole is at ( "

message = message + TFormedX() + ",  " + TFormedY() + ",  " + TFormedZ() + " )"
